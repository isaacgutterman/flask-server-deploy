"Introduction to Moles - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 1a","In this video, Mr. Krug gives new AP Chemistry students an introduction to the mole concept and an overview of the size of Avogadro's Number.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFHXfugRHtI&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=1,one of the most fundamental concepts in all of chemistry is the concept of the mole and it's appropriate that we're talking about that very first here in unit one of AP Chemistry the SI unit of substance is the mole and when we use that term we're talking about a very large number of objects that number as you might read is 600 to 6 tillion of course it's not practical to write that number out most of the time so we usually use scientific notation and we say it's about 6.02 or 6.022 times 10 to the 23rd items or objects that's how many things there are in a mole that's a very large number now just to illustrate this if we had that many grains of rice and you all know that grains of rice are very very small that would be enough to fill all the land area in the whole world to a depth of 250 feet that is a lot of rice that's more rice than has been grown since the beginning of of human history as far as we know if you had about that number of hockey pucks that would have about the same mass as the Moon on the same scale that many molecules of water it's a very small amount in fact it's about 18 milliliters or about six tenths of an ounce of water so by thinking about this we can see how large this number is by the way this number is 626 trillion 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd we call this Avogadro's Number sometimes because it is named after Amadeo Avogadro the scientists who did some of the work that helped us to discover that number this also helps us to see that Avogadro's number represents atoms molecules that are exceedingly tiny it is unimaginably small to think about how how small atoms and molecules are very very small objects that's why we need such a big number to talk about them now when we describe a mole if we talk about one mole of carbon that is specifically referring to Avogadro's Number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd atoms of carbon if we talk about a mole of water well water doesn't appear in atoms its unit is called a molecule so that would be referring to Avogadro's number of molecules of water if we say one mole of sodium chloride well the the unit that we use for sodium chloride is not called a molecule since it's an ionic compound we call it a formula unit so that would be Avogadro's number of sodium chloride formula units one mole of bromine br2 that would be that many molecules of bromine if we have ions we can talk about a mole of ions as well that just means 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd sodium ions we can use a mole to talk about pretty much anything a mole of anything really just refers to 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd fundamental units of whatever that substance happens to be whether it's a an atom or a molecule or an ion or a formula unit whatever it happens to be a mole is just 602 sextillion of those objects now we can work problems with this as well here's an here's a nice example of that let's say we have .380 moles of carbon dioxide and we want to figure out how many molecules of carbon dioxide we're dealing with well we work this problem just like we have before in the introductory unit we learned about dimensional analysis and if we're converting from moles to molecules well you want to put moles on the bottom because whatever unit you start with needs to go on the opposite side of the conversion factor and then since we're converting to molecules that's going to go on top and we've just learned that one mole is the same as 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd molecules of pretty much any any compound there so we can cancel moles and on our calculator you're going to take 0.380 times Avogadro's number and when you key that in you get the answer 2.29 times 10 to the 23rd molecules of carbon dioxide and we can go in the other direction as well if we have a question that says a sample of 1.02 times 10 to the 24th ions of calcium 2 plus is equivalent to how many moles we work the problem pretty much the same way except we write down what's given to us here this time it's 1.02 times 10 to the 24th ions of calcium and this time we're converting it to moles so at the end we're going to have moles in our conversion factor this time ions will go on the bottom and moles will go on the top and we know that one mole is equivalent to Avogadro's number of ions so we can cancel ions and this time we're going to divide we take 1.02 times 10 to the 24th and divide that by 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd and when you key that in you should get an answer of about 1.69 moles of calcium now just as a reminder I'm trying to be consistent with my significant figures my question in both of these examples actually had three significant figures So my answer should have three significant figures as well try to be consistent with that now another way to talk about a mole is with the mass what is the mass of a mole you know it's honestly not very practical to Counting atoms and molecules no one's ever going to sit down and start counting atoms take a look at a table let's count you know one two three it would be impossible basically uh ridiculous to actually sit down and count atoms the way that we count is by weighing or by finding the mass of a mole the mass of one mole if we look at any periodic table Square just look at the atomic mass right there and express that atomic mass in grams and so as you can see down here one mole of copper is going to have a mass of 63.456 grams as we can see and that works for pretty much any element one mole is equal to its atomic mass expressed in grams and if we have a compound it works the same way except you just have to add up its individual atomic masses so if we have salt sodium chloride and you want to find out what's the mass of one mole of salt well you're just going to take the individual periodic table squares and add up the atomic masses so sodium is about 22.99 and chlorine is about 35.45 so that gets us about 58.44 grams in one mole of sodium chloride just so you know in this course I will try to to round these off to the nearest hundredths place that's a good habit to get into don't round off too much try to to get you enough significant figures in there so that it doesn't adversely affect your answer whenever you do calculations with this that's why I I try to use two decimal places on these now we call this the molar mass as in the mass of one mole of a substance so we'd say the molar mass of sodium chloride is 58.44 grams or the molar mass of copper is about 63.55 grams molar mass now we can also use molar mass and talk about it in a very very tiny aspect and call that the formula mass if we're talking about ionic compounds so in the case of aluminum oxide we just look at the periodic table and since we have two aluminum atoms we multiply that by the 26.98 atomic mass and that gets us about 53.96 and we have three oxygens at about 16.00 atomic mass units a piece to get us 48 and when you add that together you get 101.96 atomic mass units that's the formula mass of that now the molar mass of that is 101.96 grams molar mass is always just expressed in grams we can do the same thing for magnesium nitrate in this in this case here we have one magnesium at about 24.31 so we have that we have two nitrogens at about 14.01 a p so that's 28.02 we have six oxygens 3 times 2 is 6 at about 16.00 a piece to get us 96 so when you add that up that's 148.33 atomic mass units if the question were what's the molar mass of this it would just be 148.33 grams the molar mass is always in grams now we can do the same thing for molecular compounds except on the microscopic or submicroscopic scale we'd call that molecular mass so water probably that's the most common one that we think of when we say a molecular compound we have two of these at 1.008 a piece I'm trying to use four sig figs there to make it 2.016 and then we have one oxygen atom at about 16 so we have 16 there add it up it's about 18.02 approximately atomic mass units the molar mass of water 18.02 grams and we could do that for other molecular compounds here's sucrose a normal table sugar we have 12 carbons at 12.01 and that gets us a little over 144 we have 22 hydrogens and we have 11 oxygens and when you add these together we get that the molecular mass of sucrose is about 342.30 atomic mass units and of course the molar mass of that the mass of one mole of this stuff would be 342.30 grams I hope you learned something here if you're if you did learn something please hit that Thumbs Up Button I'm Jeremy Krug and I hope to see you again on my channel,"17,843",0,1
"Molar Mass and its Applications - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 1b","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how molar mass can be applied to various situations, including calculating the percent by mass for the elements in a compound.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dijmukeZ2WE&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=2,in the last video we looked at how to work with the mole concept and in this video we're going to take it a little bit further here it's very important to be able to calculate the percent mass in a compound we just said that for example in our last video we calculated that aluminum oxide has that overall total formula mass of 101.96 well to find the percent mass for each element we just take each individual's each individual element's Mass value and divide it by the total so for aluminum here we take the 53.96 and divide it by the total the 101.96 of course multiply that by 100 and you get 52.92 percent and do the same thing for the oxygen take the 48.00 and divide it by the total and you get 47.08 percent that means if you have a sample of let's say a hundred grams of aluminum oxide 52.92 grams of that 52.92 percent would be aluminum and the rest would be oxygen so that's how we can determine the percent mass in a compound we can do that for any compound so in this case magnesium nitrate for magnesium we just take you know each of those individual values and divide them by the total and you find magnesium is 16.39 percent nitrogen is 18.89 percent and oxygen is 64.72 percent and it doesn't have to be ionic you can do this for the molecular compounds we talked about as well in the last video so in the case of water you know hydrogen would be about 2.02 divided by your 18.02 about 11.2 percent the same thing for for oxygen the 16 divided by the total gets you about 88.8 percent and of course to check your work you can add up your percents and your percent should add up to a hundred percent or something very very close to that for the sucrose we do the same thing just take each of your individual uh totals for your individual elements and divide them by the total and you get the percent of each element in the compound by mass a very useful a little calculation to do for uh for your compounds now we're going to do some other conversions here with the mole Concept in this problem we have a 33.9 gram sample of aluminum oxide and the question is how many formula units are we going to have here well we always start by writing down what's given to us the 33.9 grams of aluminum oxide so we write that down and as you see here in the the note here always convert to moles first if you have multiple steps convert to moles or like I sometimes say all roads lead to moles so convert to moles first and we're going to have formula units down here at the end but we're converting to moles first that means grams have to go on the bottom because that's what we're trying to get rid of and one mole on top how many grams are in one mole of aluminum oxide well we figure that out in an earlier slide we saw it was 101.96 grams didn't we so we can cancel the grams now we're going from moles to formula units so in our next conversion factor it'll be one mole on the bottom and how many formula units are in a mole well it's 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd so we can cancel moles and on our calculator we type in 33.9 divided by 101.96 times 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd just as a reminder if the number is in the numerator you multiply by that number if it's in the denominator you divide by that number and so when you key it in you should get an answer of about 2.00 times 10 to the 23rd formula units now let's try another example how about this one here in grams what is the mass of one molecule of water well it's not 18.02 grams I'll tell you that because 18.02 grams is the mass of one mole of water not one molecule so we have to do a conversion here I start by writing down one molecule of water and says what is the mass and so that means we have to convert to grams down here at the end and since we have multiple steps what unit do we convert to First moles right all roads lead to moles so we're going to put molecules on the bottom and one mole on the top and we know that there are 6.02 times 10 to the to the 23rd molecules in one mole we're going to cancel molecules and now we're going to go from moles to grams and so in our next step mole on the bottom and grams on the top and how many grams are in one mole of water well you might remember or you can add it up using the periodic table two hydrogens and one oxygen gets you about 18.02 grams in one mole so we cancel that out and we take one divided by Avogadro's number times 18.02 and we get an answer of about 2.99 times 10 to the negative 23rd grams of water that's a very small number and that makes sense because if we're trying to find the mass of one molecule of water it should be a very very small number always double check your answers whenever you work through these make sure that your answer makes sense here's another good question how many hydrogen atoms are contained within 1.00 grams of water well once again we're starting with one gram of water and this time we're being asked about atoms of hydrogen so that's going to be our our unit we have at the end and we have obviously multiple steps because we can't go directly from grams to atoms so what do we convert to First always convert to moles first all roads lead to mold so grams will go on the bottom and one mole on top how many grams are in a mole of that compound well we just use it in the last problem didn't we 18.02 so we have that grams are out and now we're in moles of water what do we convert to next maybe we need to switch over because we're going from what we're starting with water and we're talking about hydrogen here at the end so let's let's go from from water to hydrogen so I'm going to put water on the bottom and hydrogen on the top now if you look at the formula for water it's H2O that little 2 there tells us that there are two hydrogen atoms in every one water molecule two h's in every one water now this is called a mole ratio and we're going to do a lot of this here later on but this is our first example of this so we're going to have two h's to one water that's that's the ratio here two to one so I'm going to cancel out my water and now I'm in moles of hydrogen I want to be in atoms of hydrogen so now I can go from moles to atoms by putting one mole on the bottom and Avogadro's number of atoms on the top when I cancel moles now I can calculate this I've got the 1.00 divide by 18.02 times 2 times 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd so when you key this into your calculator your answer should be somewhere pretty close to 6.68 times 10 to the 22nd atoms of water once again a very large number that makes sense because we're asking about how many atoms are in there I hope you learned something from my video if you did please give me a thumbs up I hope to see you again as we move on to unit 1 Section 2.,"4,224",0,2
"Isotopes, Atomic Mass, & Mass Spectroscopy - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 2","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses Topic 2 in AP Chemistry Unit 1, which covers the concepts of isotopes, atomic mass calculations as a weighted average, and how to interpret a mass spectroscopy graph.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzky1T4RYIs&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=3,in unit 1 Section 2 we're looking at the concept of Isotopes now if you look at the symbol for an isotope it's very likely going to look something like this now that letter P of course represents the symbol of the element so that's one of the ways that we know that this is phosphorus now the number on the bottom here that represents the atomic number and that represents the number of protons in an atom sometimes we use the abbreviation Z to talk about the atomic number now this atomic number corresponds to the atomic number that whole number on the periodic table for that element that's another way that we know that this is phosphorus because if you have a periodic table handy you can perhaps have one and you can see that the atomic number 15 also corresponds to phosphorus so this number down here should match up with the elemental symbol now the number on the top is the mass number and that's the sum of the protons and the neutrons in an atom that's going to identify the isotope so if you have a question where it asks you how many neutrons there are well you're going to have to take the top number this mass number and subtract the bottom number so this particular isotope would have 16 neutrons in it now if the question ever asks how many electrons well as long as we have a neutral atom and it's not ionized well the number of protons should be equal to the number of electrons so in this case we would call this isotope phosphorus 31 that's just its name we call it use the the name of the element with a dash and then the mass number so it's phosphorus 31. if we were asked how many protons well the atomic number 15 will be that the number of electrons it's going to be the same as long as this atom is not ionized so it's also 15 electrons and like we said neutrons we have to subtract so 31 minus 15 would be 16 neutrons now we can do some practice with this if we have this isotope of strontium how many protons well that number on the bottom the atomic number tells us it's 38 protons and electrons it's the same 38 electrons because there's no evidence that this is ionized in any way and then neutrons well we have to subtract 95 minus 38 so that looks to be about 57 neutrons so we would call this isotope strontium 95 using the the mass number to identify the isotope let's try this symbol right here once again protons the number on the bottom it's 54 and then it's also 54 electrons and to find neutrons we have to subtract don't we so 132 minus 54 gets us the 78 neutrons we'd call this Xenon 132 that's the name of the isotope now we have this one we have plutonium here once again 94 protons 94 electrons and subtract to get that number of neutrons about 148 neutrons this is plutonium 242. so that's how you can figure out the number of protons electrons and neutrons for any isotope and of course it's its name now when we talk about Isotopes Isotopes are essentially different varieties of an element and they all have the same number of protons like in this case we have isotopes of hydrogen there are three isotopes of hydrogen that we know of all three of them have one proton because that's what hydrogen is everything that's hydrogen has to have one proton and everything that has one proton has to be hydrogen what's negotiable is the number of neutrons so most atoms of hydrogen actually don't have any neutrons at all and so we'd call that hydrogen one sometimes we call it protium that's a a different name for that isotope almost all something like 99.989 percent of all hydrogen atoms are that isotope but there's another isotope that has one Neutron we call that deuterium or hydrogen II and it has about 0.011 percent of all the atoms of hydrogen that we know of in the world and then there's a third isotope that's present in just a trace amount in nature it's called tritium or hydrogen 3 and it has one proton and two neutrons so these are how the Isotopes are different they have different numbers of neutrons now one important thing to know about these isotopes is that they have different masses different abundances sometimes a certain isotope might be radioactive while different isotopes of of that element are not but chemically speaking they all behave exactly the same and so if you took a cup of water that had all deuterium in it instead of the regular hydrogen one it would go down just the same as regular water it might be a little bit heavier you may or may not be able to tell but it would have the same chemical properties all isotopes of an element behave the same chemically now when we talk about average atomic mass we might wonder how we get that number where does the 1.0079 come from well it comes from a weighted average an average mass of all the atoms of that element now let me show you how we calculate that let's say we have this problem right here where the two main isotopes of hydrogen are protium and deuterium protium has an atomic mass of 1.0078 atomic mass units and represents 99.989 percent of hydrogen atoms deuterium has an atomic mass of 2.0141 AMU and represents .011 percent of hydrogen atoms calculate the average atomic mass of hydrogen well what we do is we take each Isotopes Mass so in this case the first one the 1.0078 and we multiply it by its percentage abundance converted to a decimal so that's point nine nine nine eight nine and we get a value there and we do the same thing for the other Isotopes so the other isotope is 2.0141 and we multiply that by .00011 now we get this very small number then you take those two products and add them together and if you've done it correctly you should get the same average atomic mass as you see on the periodic table or at least something very very close to it and we do so that's how you calculate the average atomic mass for an element now sometimes you may have a problem like this where it says that gallium has two main naturally occurring isotopes gallium 69 has a mass of 68.926 AMU and an abundance of 60.108 percent what is the mass of gallium 71 . so it looks like we have a puzzle basically here because we're not being asked what's the average atomic mass of the element we're being asked to essentially work backwards and find the mass of one of the Isotopes we can set the problem up the same way what I would do is I would start by by writing down this number the 69.723 and you might be wondering where in the world does that number come from because that's not in the problem well that is from the periodic table that is the average atomic mass of the of that element from the table 69.723 and then I'm going to take this other isotope the 68.926 and multiply it by its abundance the point 60 108 and I get this number and now I know that there should be some other number in here that I would have so I'm going to subtract so I take the 69.723 minus 41.430 and I get 28.293 now that number is going to be the product of the percentage abundance of the other isotope times its mass so I'm slowly working backwards and getting back to that original number now what is the percentage abundance of the other isotope well it has to be 39.892 percent now how did I get that number well the problem says that we have two naturally occurring Isotopes here and if we have two isotopes and one is 60.108 percent well your two percents have to add up to a hundred I don't think so just subtract from a hundred and that's how you get this other percent or subtract from one in the in this case so now we can divide we just take the 28.293 and divide by 0.39892 and we should get the mass of the other isotope which is about 70.925 now occasionally they do ask this type of problem on the AP exam sometimes they don't but this is a very good skill to be able to calculate the mass of a missing isotope now you might wonder how do we get these numbers how do we figure out the mass of an isotope because you can't really take an atom an individual atom and place it on a little teeny tiny scale and figure out its mass that would be ridiculous well we have an instrument that helps us to analyze the relative abundance of Isotopes in a sample this is how we get these values this is called a mass spectrometer or sometimes a mass spec for short and if we take a super purified sample of zirconium and stick this into the mass spec we can get a little graph here that shows us the analysis of zirconium so we have the relative abundances here it shows each each little bar on the graph represents a different isotope and the height represents the relative abundance in percent and then how far left and right it is shows the atomic mass of each ice at all so we can get some very valuable data out of this so for example if we were to ask how many isotopes of zirconium are represented on the graph I hope that you could count that there are five little bars here so that shows this that there are five Isotopes here and if the question was which of the Isotopes is the most abundant well the one that has the the tallest bar so that would have to be zirconium 90. it's got something like maybe about 52 percent abundance there and the least abundant would have to be the the shortest bar so that would be zirconium 96 something like maybe two or three percent would be there if it says estimate the abundance of one of these Isotopes well zirconium 92 now zirconium 92 of course would have to be right here it's labeled it's also right at the 92 Mark there what is the abundance well it's between 10 and 20. it looks like it'd be about maybe 17 18 percent so you should be able to answer questions like this by looking at a mass spectrometer graph now let's say we have a question like this this is a sample multiple choice question and it says which of the following elements has the Mass Spectrum represented here and we have we have this Mass Spec graph and we have a choice of four elements now you you will need a periodic table in order to answer this question you're going to have to eyeball basically the the center of this where is the approximate weighted average of all this we have a couple graphs that are you know taller and smaller than others it looks to me like the average is somewhere around 96 that's what I would say so what I'm going to do is look at my periodic table and find an element that has an atomic mass that's very close to 96 and as I look on the table I see that molybdenum is very close to that 95.95 so I'm going to say the answer is Choice B now the only other answer that's even possibly reasonable is niobium in B but if I look at the table you know it has an atomic mass of about 92.91 which that's not really in the center as you eyeball this try to get somewhere in the center of that weighted average that's why molybdenum is the correct answer for this let's try one more multiple choice question let's imagine that we have two different ionic compounds that each contain only copper and chlorine both compounds are powders one white and one brown an elemental analysis is performed on each powder which of the following questions about the compounds is most likely to be answered by the results of the analysis and we have different questions here what is the density what's the formula unit what's the chemical reactivity which is more soluble well if we're doing an elemental analysis then what we'll be able to find out will be how many atoms of each element are in the compound so that would be Choice B what's the formula unit for these other things like density reactivity solubility the best way to determine those things would be not with an elemental analysis but rather by carrying out those those actual processes in the laboratory my name is Jeremy Krug I hope you've enjoyed this video and

"Composition of Pure Substances - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 3","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses how to determine the elemental composition of pure substances and how to calculate the empirical formula of a substance from mass percent data.  He also shows the difference between empirical formula and molecular formula, working several examples.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uqIROUX0js&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=4,in unit 1 Section 3 we're talking about chemical formulas and where they come from now all the way back in the 1700s we have this French chemist named Joseph proust who found that different samples of a chemical compound are always going to have the same composition of elements and he was able to to figure this out by analyzing different samples of of the same compound he called this the law of constant composition sometimes called the law of definite proportions and we find that this is true today we find that for example if you have a sample of water it doesn't matter where that water comes from it's always going to be about 11 percent hydrogen and about 89 oxygen doesn't matter where that water comes from now at the same time if we take other compounds like sodium chloride doesn't matter where the sodium chloride comes from as long as it's a pure sample it's going to be about 39 sodium and about 61 percent chlorine so this is the constant composition that we see for these chemical compounds now John Dalton a British chemist in the early 1800s basically was able to take some ideas that other previous scientists had had thought about and that come up with including proust and some others like uh like Antoine Lavoisier and explain the way that chemicals behaved by the existence of atoms and so he came up with this atomic theory to explain why chemicals and and substances behave the way they do this had four statements the first statement of his atomic theory was that all elements are composed of atoms the time it was a very revolutionary thought to say that that there were atoms this was not something that people really thought of too much a second part was that atoms cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction and we know that that certainly is true today the third part was that atoms of one element are different from atoms of other elements and that all atoms of an element are identical to each other now if you watched the last video in uh unit one section two we know that the second part of that is wrong we know that there are these things called Isotopes you can have different varieties of an element like we saw the three isotopes of hydrogen they're not identical so that part of his atomic theory was wrong but the first part of it is certainly correct atoms of hydrogen are going to be completely different from atoms of oxygen on the other hand the fourth part was that all compounds have a fixed ratio of atoms of elements and that sounds a whole lot like the law of constant composition that we just saw from Joseph proust now when we take a compound we have learned already how to calculate the mass percent so just as a very quick example in the case of caffeine there's its formula we just take each number each number of atoms there multiplied by its atomic mass you know we have 12 for carbon and about one for hydrogen and about 14 for nitrogen and 16 for oxygen and then we add those values together and we see that the overall molecular mass of caffeine is about 194.0 AMU and to find the percent mass for each of those individual elements we just take the individual products for each element and divide by the total so carbon is you know 96 divided by 194 which is about 49.5 percent and hydrogen is 10 divided by the total about 5.2 percent and nitrogen in the same way oxygen is the same way so this is the percent mass now is it possible for us to go in the other direction is it possible for us to take these percents and work backwards and get back to a formula well I think it is now let's see how we do that let's take those percents that we just calculated and we're going to go backwards we're going to determine the empirical formula of caffeine now the way that we do this is we take those four or however many percent values we have given to us and we write them down and notice this is percent by Mass and so since it's percent by mass I can call those percents gram values so it's like if we had a sample of 100 grams of caffeine 49.5 grams would be carbon and 5.2 grams would be hydrogen and so forth now just like in any of these conversion problems a good first step is always to convert to moles isn't it that was one thing we saw way back in uh in section one of unit one so we're going to take all these gram values and convert them to moles using their individual atomic masses and so we just just do that we have the mole values so 4.125 moles and so forth now once we have moles we're going to divide each of those by the smallest of those mole values so as I look at those those four mole values down here I see that the smallest one is 1.031 so I'm going to divide all of those by the 1.031 now when I do that I get a number of 4 or very close to 4 for carbon I get very very close to 5 for hydrogen I get very close to 2 for nitrogen and I've will of course get one for oxygen these the four five the two and the one represent the subscripts so we have C4 H5 N2 o so that's the empirical formula of caffeine now you might be thinking hang on a second we saw the formula for caffeine on the last slide and this was not it so what's the deal here we we actually don't have the real formula this is what's called the empirical and the empirical formula is a formula for a compound that represents the lowest common ratio for atoms of each element it's kind of like a formula that's been reduced down to lowest terms it's like for example if we have glucose that has the actual or the molecular C6H12O6 if you reduce that down to lowest terms it's mole it's empirical formula becomes C H2O because you can divide each of those subscripts by a factor of six so ch2o is the empirical formula or this here we have this compound called hydrazine it's n2h4 that's the actual or the molecular formula for that compound and we can divide both of those subscripts by 2. and make the empirical formula nh2 now sometimes the molecular formula is the same as the empirical formula because water actually is H2O but you can't reduce that down anymore so its empirical formula is also H2O in the case of tetraphosphorus adek oxide p4o10 we can reduce that down to an empirical formula of p2o5 can't we so we have a molecular formula and we have an empirical formula which is in lowest terms so is there a way to go from empirical formula to molecular formula in the case of our little caffeine problem here well yes there is and that little nugget of information that we need in order to make that last conversion is the molecular mass of the substance so here's the empirical formula of caffeine that we just calculated and it says that the molecular mass of the caffeine is 194.0 with that now we can go to the molecular formula and the way that we do that is we take the empirical formula that we just calculated and we add up the atomic masses of all these and we find the molecular mass of this object here so four carbons that's 12 a piece 48 we have five hydrogens at about one a piece that's five two nitrogens at 14 a piece that's 28 and one oxygen which is 16. that adds up to 97. now the molecular mass is 194. so we divide the molecular mass by the empirical mass that we just got and we find that the ratio there is two so what that means is we have to multiply the empirical formula by two and when we do that we multiply all those subscripts by 2 we get the C8 h10 and 402 that's the exact same molecular formula that we had way back at the beginning of this problem so that's how you can go from the percent by mass data backwards to the empirical formula and even the molecular formula so that's actually a very neat little calculation to do let's try one more example here we're going to take a compound this time with nitrogen and oxygen and it has 25.93 percent nitrogen and 74.07 oxygen let's find the empirical formula so once again we have those two gram values and first thing that you want to do is convert the gram values to moles so we're going to divide nitrogen by about 14 grams in a mole and oxygen by about 16 grams in a mole and when we do this we get about 1.852 moles of nitrogen and about 4.629 moles of oxygen now what's the next step we have to take both of these mole values and divide by the smallest or the smaller of those two in this case so that's 1.852 so of course this first number is going to be a one and when I key this into my calculator I get 2.50 so it looks like my subscripts are 1 and 2 and a half and we all know that you can't have half of an atom can you you can't have a formula of n o two and a half it doesn't work that way so what we do is we're going to have to multiply both of these values by that denominator right there so in this case that denominator is a 2. so when I multiply by both both numbers by that value I get subscripts that are actual whole numbers now two and five so my empirical formula is N2 o5 this happens sometimes where you'll divide these numbers out and you'll have a number that's like one and the other one is let's say it's two point three three in that case that's two and a third and you'd have to multiply both of these by three as your denominator so keep an eye out for that because sometimes you'll divide these out and have a fractional value and you'll have to get a whole number ratios don't forget in a formula any formula you have to have whole numbers only hope you learned something about formulas and where we get them my name is Jeremy Craig I hope you enjoyed this video for unit one lesson three hope you give me a thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't already

"Atomic Structure & Coulomb's Law - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 5a","In this video, Mr. Krug gives students an overview of our modern view of atomic structure as well as an introduction to Coulomb's Law, which will be a vital tool in the rest of the AP Chemistry course.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tvfh15wYxY&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=6,in unit 1 Section 5 we're focusing on subatomic particles and how they interact with each other now this story kind of goes all the way back to around 1897 when a scientist named JJ Thompson was able to use something called a cathode ray tube to pass a array of particles in there and he had a positively charged metal plate and a negatively charged metal plate and he noticed that things were being deflected in the direction of the positive plate and so he realized that these atoms had negative charges in them he called them electrons and he didn't really have a very good grasp as to what they were like or how they reacted other than what you see here but he he did come up with a model being the good scientist he was he called it the plum pudding model and his idea looked something like this where he thought that these electrons were like these little pods or these little bubbles that were kind of floating around randomly in the atom while the rest of the atom was this positively charged gel for lack of a better word it's called The Plum Pudding model because he said that these electrons were randomly distributed kind of like plums in Plum Pudding so that was his idea now over time this got refined Ernest Rutherford about 15 or so years later was in charge of an experiment where he propelled alpha particles which are very dense positively charged particles at a very thin piece of gold foil now this is a little picture or kind of a cartoon of how this worked he set up this gold foil here and he had a device that essentially shot these alpha particles at the gold foil now in his idea if the plum pudding model was correct pretty much all of those alpha particles would have gone straight through the gold foil well he found that that's not exactly what happened as you can see in this little cartoon here some and this is kind of exaggerated but some of those alpha particles were deflected and a very small fraction of these alpha particles actually were almost reflected completely and bounced off of the gold foil and came back almost in the same direction as it was shot out from which was very surprising to him he did not expect this to happen so I guess the question is why were some of the alpha particles deflected or even repelled by the gold atoms well if we think about this we know that the only way that anything can be deflected off of anything else in our macroscopic world is if something that's a very high density hits something else of very high density and they bounce off of each other and he used this to to reason and realize that you know these alpha particles had a positive charge and they were very dense they must have been hitting something else that was positively charged and also very dense inside those gold atoms and so that's why there was that reflection or that the deflection in the gold foil experiment he realized that inside each one of those gold atoms there had to be something that was very dense something that was positively charged he called that the nucleus and he called those positive charges inside the atoms protons and so this gold foil experiment was an excellent way to demonstrate that there are protons and they're in this very dense nucleus of the atom so slowly this uh understanding of the atom is being revised and refined now we go backward a few years and we have Robert Milliken and he actually was focused on the electrons he used something called the oil drop experiment where he charged up these little tiny droplets of oil and he was able to determine the charge of an individual electron and he used this electric field in order to do that so he calculated that the electric charge of one electron was about 1.592 times 10 to the negative 19th coulombs so there we have that value very ingenious experiment for all the way back there in 1908. now if we go forward a bit more we have Niels Bohr and he was thinking about electrons as well and his theory his his evidence showed that electrons existed in these energy levels and they were spinning around the nucleus now he did not have an exact uh idea as to what these energy levels looked like but he theorized or he hypothesized I suppose that they looked kind of like this or these atoms had electrons that were basically orbiting the nucleus kind of like planets do in the solar system this these circular energy levels this was his idea now today we know that energy levels don't actually look like that that's not what they look like but that was his idea and this kind of gives us a model to work with now one thing that he got very right on here was that electrons can jump they can move from one energy level to another and so this this electron here for example in this first energy level it can jump to the second or to the third or one from the third can jump to the second but they cannot hover between levels so they can be in the first they can be in the second they can't be like floating in between and that's something we call a quantized function something that's a Quantum function exists in one level or a different level or a different level but it can't be floating in between it's kind of like steps on a staircase you know that you can be standing on one step in the staircase or you could be standing on one above it or one below it but you can't levitate in between the steps and that's kind of what we have here you can have an electron in an energy level one above it one below it but it can't be floating or levitating in between and so that's what we're talking about when we say Quantum in this context it's a measurement or some sort of of a function that exists only in discrete or complete steps not in not not floating around in the middle or fractional amounts James Chadwick was yet another scientist who discovered that there were uncharged particles along with protons in the nucleus and that was in the early 1930s these were called neutrons we know that they have no charge about the same mass as a proton if you want to get technical they weigh a little bit more than a proton but but not much and this was essentially the basis for nuclear science Nuclear Physics they were able to take this complete story of the atom the protons and the neutrons and to a lesser extent those electrons and within you know 13 years of James Chadwick's Discovery they were able to create the first nuclear weapon so we have those scientists that helped us understand the story of the atom now today we know that atoms are composed of protons in the nucleus those are the positively charged particles those have a mass of about one atomic mass unit and then we have neutrons like we said those don't have any charges those are neutral and so that's why they're called you know neutrons because they're neutral and they also have a mass of about one atomic mass unit and then we have the electrons those are much much smaller than protons and neutrons and they're buzzing around the nucleus in what we sometimes call the electron cloud now you can see how much smaller and how much less massive they are than protons and neutrons about one eighteen hundred and twentieth of the mass of those particles in the nucleus they have a negative charge now this is a picture that you've probably seen before where you have you know neutrons and protons in the middle electrons buzzing around there is a major it's I say that there's a little problem that's actually a rather a major problem with this picture and the fact is the picture is not drawn to scale in fact it's not even close to scale because if you wanted to draw or visualize an atom that actually was drawn to scale you might need something that's about the size of this football stadium here so let's imagine that we're going to make the model of an atom the size of that football stadium right there now if that's the case the nucleus is going to be a dime on the 50-yard line so imagine a dime on the 50-yard line well the electrons would be grains of sand buzzing around in those outside stands that's what you'd have to have in order to have an atom drawn essentially to scale now that tells us that the vast majority of an atom is empty space over 99.9999999 of an atom is empty space which means you know you're made of atoms so almost all of you would be empty space almost all of me would be empty space if you were to extract all the empty space out of a person you'd have someone that weighed basically the same as they do now except they'd be about the size of a grain of sand and they would be pure protons electrons and neutrons but of course that's not how a matter is in our in our world at least now let's take a look at two relatively simple atoms in fact these are for all practical purposes the two simplest atoms that exist hydrogen and helium and you can see these of course these are not drawn to scale this is just a little cartoon that I made to help us visualize these now imagine or ask yourself from which of these atoms would it be easier to remove an electron so think about that and the answer is it is easier to remove an electron from hydrogen and do you see why that is we have basically two types of particles here we have protons that are positively charged and we have electrons that are negatively charged I've left out the neutrons because they don't have a charge and so there's no real positive or negative attractive Force there so it's easier to take one away from hydrogen because there's less attractive Force there's only one positive charge here that's holding in the electron whereas over here we have two protons that are holding in the electrons the idea here is that the greater the magnitude of the charge the greater the attraction so what we have here is what's sometimes called an electrostatic force basically that just means the positive attracting the negative and the more positive and more negative charge you have the stronger they tend to attract each other so these here in helium would be more strongly attracted a plus two to a minus two will have the stronger traction than a A plus one minus one so it's relatively easier or easy to remove that electron from hydrogen now let's look at two other atoms we have hydrogen and helium but let's let's change gears here and this time let's look at Helium and lithium so helium and lithium look kind of like this once again not really drawn to scale just just an idea here to help us visualize I'm going to ask the same question from now you notice we have another factor in play here because it's true that we have a plus two and a minus two for the helium and a plus three and a basically a minus three for this lithium but notice what else we have over here there is a new energy level this last electron in lithium is farther away from the nucleus so since it's farther away from the nucleus it has less of an attraction it's kind of like having two magnets next to each other and you know that if you have two magnets that are very close well they'll snap together very readily but if you have those two magnets that are farther apart well there's less of an attraction it's kind of the same idea here the greater the distance the lower the attraction so the answer is it's easier to remove this electron from lithium than it is to remove this last electron from Helium so I want you to think about those two factors we've just talked about there's the magnitude of the charge and the distance between the charged particles now this brings us to a very important Concept in chemistry that helps us understand atomic structure this is called Coulomb's law and this is a law that we use from physics and the F stands for the attractive forces between any two charged particles now this K stands for a constant but notice we have two other types of variables here we have the Q q1 and Q2 are the magnitude of charge of each of the two charged particles and then the d stands for the distance between the two charged particles now if we think about this from a mathematical point of view you can see that if these values for Q go up then the force goes up as well so what this tells us is more strong of a charge greater magnitude of charge means we have a stronger attractive Force that's why the plus two and minus 2 had a stronger traction than the plus one minus 1. like we had in that example earlier now D is for distance and notice it's in the denominator so that tells us that if the distance is higher you know this denominator gets larger that's going to make this whole value smaller so what that tells us is that the greater the distance the less the attractive force and that tells us why lithium since its last electron was was farther away would have a lower attractive Force okay and this is just an introduction to Coulomb's law we'll get more into detail with this and learn some more things about this in future lessons this is just an introduction to it right now now let's go back to these two atoms we looked at uh here a minute ago and let's explain why it's easier for lithium to lose that last electron then for helium to lose that electron so what is the deciding force is it the magnitude of charge or is it the distance well you can see it's the distance this this electron here is farther away from the nucleus than we have in helium lithium's outermost electron is in that second occupied energy level it's located a greater distance from that nucleus than in the case for helium in its outermost electron which is only in the first occupied energy level so as we think about Coulomb's law and the parts of an atom and how they're attracted to each other this really helps us to understand how atoms and the parts of an atom interact with each other hope you enjoyed this lesson hope you learned something from it and if you did please give me a thumbs up and I hope to see you again on my channel in the future,"3,964",0,6
"Electron Configurations - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 5b","In this video, Mr. Krug reviews the 'periodic table' method of writing electron configurations and shows how the Aufbau principle correlates with the orbital diagram notation for electron configurations.  He also reviews Hund's Rule and the Pauli Exclusion Principle and discusses the shapes of atomic orbitals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvhHMbXLi-U&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=7,in our second video of unit 1 lesson five we're going to focus on how electrons are configured in atoms now it's very important to be able to write electron configurations for pretty much any atom on the periodic table that follows the the patterns for those so if you took first your Chemistry you probably did something like this where we have a periodic table and we just try looking at different atoms so here's carbon and the way that you write an electron configuration is you always start at the beginning of the table and we start with one s 2 because there are two boxes there and then we go to 2s2 and then 2p 2 because it's in the 2p section there's the second box so it's 2p2 now if you want you can abbreviate this by backing up to the most recent noble gas which in this case is helium and then kind of pick up from there so you can say helium 2s2 2p2 and that works as well if you want to try let's say calcium which is right here once again we always start at the beginning of the periodic table this is like a like a bus driver driving along the Route and the bus driver has to hit all the stops go along all the streets so it goes 1s2 and then 2s 2 P 6 because there are six boxes in that 2p section back around to 3s 2. and then 3p 6. and then 4S 2 because calcium is the second box in the 4S section 4s2 so you can write your electron configuration just like that if you want to abbreviate it using the noble gas abbreviations you would back up to argon which is right before that and say argon and then 4s2 so you can do that as well let's try this next one here niobium so once again we start at the beginning it's going to be 1s 2 and then 2s to 2p 6 then 3s 2 3p 6. 4S 2 just keep keep going in order of these little sections here 3D and that has 10 boxes 3D 10. and then 4p 6 and back around 5S 2 and then in the 4D section niobium is the third box with 4D 3. so you can write it like that or if you want to abbreviate it that would be uh looks like Krypton and then 5s2 for D3 so that's how you can write an electron configuration now maybe you're wondering what does all this stuff mean you know they got the S's and the P's and the D's and all that and sometimes the F's as you see here at the bottom of the table well we can actually write an orbital notation now the way this works is if we use the electron configuration for carbon each little section here represents we can draw it with lines One S two s and and 2p your s sections will always have one line or one orbital as we say the the P's will have three lines or three orbitals and you just start putting arrows on the line so 1s2 represents that put one Arrow up one going down and we use the alpha principle here the idea is that electrons are added to these orbitals and sublevels in a specific order it goes in increasing energy generally speaking so we go with One S and then we do 2s so 2s2 we've got two arrows there one going up one going down and then we have 2p2 the first one goes right there now where would the second one go you might think right next to it but actually it doesn't there's a a rule called Huns Rule and Hun's rule says that no electron can be paired until every orbital in that section or that sublevel has one electron in it so that means that you can't double up until every one of these lines has an arrow on it so that means that our second electron will actually have to go right here so that's the orbital notation when you draw the arrows on the lines now there is some vocabulary that we need to be aware of we've already talked about energy levels we have the one and the the twos here those represent energy levels but the S's and the P's represent sublevels and so this 2p as an example we'd call that the two-piece sub-level every one of these sections in the electron configuration represents a sub level now within each sub-level we have each individual line each line represents an orbital and we'll talk about what an orbital is here shortly so orbitals are like this and so we would have you know each 2p sublevel would have three orbitals represented and this one only two of those orbitals are occupied this last one of course is empty now let's try this with another element that's a little bit more complex let's try selenium and so we'll put all these orbital uh lines on here in the sub levels as well and just so that there's no confusion anytime we have an s sublevel notice it only has one line one orbital all the P sub levels have three so here's two p and 3p and there's 4p up there as well each of those has three lines or three orbitals and there is a d sub level here in the 3D it has five orbitals and so we're going to start filling those up so we'll start with 1s2 by the way if you ever get to F it's going to be seven orbitals but we don't usually do that in AP Chemistry so One S has two so we'll pair them up like this and just so you know the reason that they're going in opposite directions one arrow is going up and one arrow is going down is we have something called the poly Exclusion Principle and this basically tells us that no two electrons in an atom can have the same Quantum States and so what that means is the two electrons have to be spinning in opposite directions so if one is spinning like this that means the other has to be spinning in the opposite direction so it's why they're they're in in you have two arrows in different directions now 2s2 looks like that and then two piece six we got one two three and then four five six just like we did for Hun's rule put one on each line before you double up and then three s two and to speed things along we'll do the three piece six and the 4s2 and the 3d10 we've got those 10 arrows there now for 4p4 we have to follow Hun's rule one two three and now we can double up okay so that's the orbital notation diagram for selenium I want you to notice something here we've got two unpaired electrons they're just sitting in their orbitals by themselves so since we have unpaired electrons in this atom we call this atom paramagnetic it exerts a special type of magnetism called paramagnetism now that's not something that you have to worry too much about but it is a very interesting type of magnetism that you can learn about and research on your own now let's try another one let's try argon so argon has this electron configuration we're going to set up the lines there's our set of lines our orbital notation lines here so we'll just run through here 1s2 and then 2s2 P6 3s2 and 3p6 so that fills everything up so I want you to notice that in argon all of the electrons and each electron is represented by an arrow all the electrons are paired up none of them are just kind of unpaired like we had in the last example when you have this this is called diamagnetic so if an atom doesn't have any unpaired electrons we say it's diamagnetic so there's paramagnetic and there's diamagnetic so it's interesting to know the difference between those now when we say orbital and orbital is basically just a region of space where you are most likely to find an electron it's like if I say what is a hallway well if you're in a school a hallway is a place where you're likely to find students moving around between classes so for example an S orbital if we were just to plot where these electrons are just different you know flashes in time it might look something like this this might be the plot of one electron over a certain period of time and we can see that for the most part it has a roughly spherical or circular shape there this is not in 3D just a just a picture sometimes it goes outside that orbital but for the most part it's inside that area now a p orbital if you were to plot a p orbital perhaps every second just take a just take a flash picture every every second of a p orbital over a certain period of time it might look more like this and that has what seems to be more like a figure eight structure now a d orbital might look more like this if we take that same flash every every second or so and this looks more like a butterfly or possibly a four-leaf clover these are the general shapes of the orbitals s orbitals have a spherical shape P orbitals have this figure eight shape and most of the time D orbitals have this four leaf clover type of shape when we talk about an orbital this is where electrons will spend about 90 percent of their time so that means sometimes as you can see in each of these plots they do go outside of their orbitals sometimes but they'll spend the vast majority of their time in the orbital now if you were to plot all these orbitals because we've been looking at you know 1s and 2s and 2p all of these orbitals and just plot them and see what this whole thing looks like this is what it would look like the nucleus is as we've said earlier unimaginably tiny in there all of these sublevels and orbitals are being superimposed over each other in this picture so what we have is basically all these orbitals moving around essentially on top of each other or over each other and this is what you have in an atom it looks like chaos it seems to be rather orderly as it turns out whenever we talk about the ways that you can uh predict the electron configuration for atoms hope you learned something from my video I'm Jeremy Krug I hope you'll join me for the next video which is going to cover unit 1 Section 6.,"3,682",0,7
"Photoelectron Spectroscopy - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 6","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students the easy way to interpret a photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) diagram, working several examples.  He shows how each peak of a PES diagram correlates to a specific sublevel in an atom, and how the data on the diagram can be used to calculate the ionization energy of an element.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qjsJa-dtzs&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=8,in unit 1 Section 6 we're looking at evidence for sub-levels in atoms and we're going to use something called photoelectron spectroscopy in order to demonstrate this now we're going to start by talking about the fact that there are some flaws in Niels Bohr's model of the atom so you might remember seeing pictures like this this is of course not the scale but we see an idea of what a neon atom might look like according to the Bohr model we basically have 10 protons here in the middle we have 10 electrons scattered in these two energy levels I've of course left out the neutrons well Niels Bohr thought that just for example all eight of these electrons in the second energy level were identical as it turns out today we have evidence that he was incorrect now if we take this atom and we run it through an object called a photoelectron spectroscope we actually can strip these electrons one by one away from the atom to determine the successive ionization energies or how much energy is required to strip each electron away from that atom and if we do that we get a spectrum that looks kind of like this and we don't get two peaks but we get Three Peaks and this tells us that this atom has three sublevels so it this shows us that the Bohr model is flawed there's there are sub levels not just not just energy levels and if we label these from left to right the first one on the left is 1s and then 2s and then 2p and those are the sub levels that each Peak will be representing now if you can write an electron configuration like we did in the last video then you can interpret a photoelectron spectroscopy graph it's basically the same thing you just go from left to right 1s 2s 2p and as it turns out the last Peak the very last one here the one that's labeled 2.08 that will be telling us about the the first or the the lowest ionization energy those are the easiest to remove electrons it only takes 2.08 Mega joules per mole to take those electrons away whereas in the 1s level or sublevel that would take 84.0 megajoules per mole a whole lot more now the height of each Peak corresponds to the number of electrons in the sublevel so you know that 1s has a maximum of two electrons so I'm going to go ahead and label 1s2 2s2 in fact I'll just label them all so you can see this 1s2 2s2 but this last Peak I want you to notice that this last Peak is three times taller than the other Peaks that means that it has three times as many electrons as the other Peak so that's why we can safely say this is 2p6 and if you remember back from the electron configurations you can match this up to a periodic table there and see that this is neon that's the the atom that has this electron configuration let's try another one let's try this photoelectron spectroscopy graph and let's label each Peak with its corresponding sublevel so it's this works just like an electron configuration it goes 1s and then 2s and then 2p so that's all you have to do just label from left to right just like it were an electron configuration if you can write an electron configuration you can do these how many electrons are in each sublevel well we know it goes to and 2 you know 1s and 2s are always maxed out at 2. but what about this peak this last Peak it's half as tall as the others so guess what it has half as many electrons which is means it's only got one in there so it's 1s2 2s2 to P1 now which element is this well you can match it up on your periodic table and that is boron so if you can write an electron configuration you can interpret a PES diagram now last part here let's calculate the first ionization energy per electron for this element in joules per electron now once again like I said earlier the first ionization energy that's the last Peak so we're going to take the 0.80 megajoules per mole and we're going to convert that to joules per electron down here at the end so let's convert the megajoules to joules first so one megajoule goes on the bottom and joules goes on the top hopefully you remember that there are one million joules in a mega Joule or a million of anything in a mega of anything right so Mega joules are out and now let's convert from moles to electrons so in our next conversion factor moles have to go on top to cancel and there are 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd electrons in a mole so now we can cancel moles on our calculator we take 0.80 times a million divided by 6.02 2 times 10 to the 23rd and we get an answer of about 1.3 times 10 to the negative 18 joules per electron so that's all you have to do on this type of calculation let's try one more example here let's take a look at this PES diagram and let's label it first and we'll identify the element so once again if you can do an electron configuration you can do a PES diagram just label it with the sub levels it goes 1s 2s 2p and then 3s 3p and then 4S as we you know progress our way across the periodic table there and we now we can label the the heights all of these s's are going to be 2 right because they're all the same height and we know that s Max is out of two and then the P's are all these are all three times higher than the others so that means they have three times as many electrons that would be 2p6 and 3p6 now which element is this well once again just match it up on your periodic table and see which one ends with 4s2 and that is calcium so you can do photoelectron spectroscopy diagrams hope you enjoyed this video If you learned

"Periodic Trends: Ionization Energy - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 7a","In this video, Mr. Krug begins a series of three videos about periodic trends. The focus of this video is ionization energy, and he works several examples to help students explain why different elements have higher or lower ionization energies than other elements.  He also discusses successive ionization energies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MftSzSxIWBA&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=9,unit 1 Section 7 is all about Trends or patterns that we see on the periodic table and there are mainly three of these that we're going to talk about in this section ionization energy radius and electronegativity in this first video we're going to focus mainly on ionization energy now there's an important Trend that we notice on the periodic table the more occupied energy levels there are in an atom the greater the distance the outermost electrons are from the nucleus and so if you have one energy level that's occupied it's a fairly small atom if you have five energy levels well that's much larger as far as the size of the atom goes so we can make a generalization and say that the farther down you go on the periodic table the greater the distance of the outermost electrons are from the nucleus so we're going to define the first ionization energy as the energy that's required to remove the very last electron in an atom in its gaseous form so just as an example if we're talking about lithium that would be taking an atom of lithium in its gaseous form and stripping away an electron and leaving us with Li plus in the gaseous phase and that's how you would write that equation for the first ionization energy it looks a little strange especially since lithium is not usually a gas but that's just how this is written now here is a here is a a graphic representation of the first ionization energy of the elements and I want you to notice that we seem to have some very distinct patterns here we start out with hydrogen it goes Sky High for helium and then when we start a new period with lithium it drops down very very low and then as we go across the periodic table again it slowly increases up to Neon and then when it starts the third period it sinks way down again and this is a pattern that just kind of keeps repeating itself there are some anomalies here as you can see but for the most part that's what's happening all the way across the periodic table now let's think about why this is the case why does it increase as we go higher so as you look at the table here you see that neon is in the area of something like 22 electron volts whereas how lithium was only like five or six so why is it over four times more difficult to remove that electron from neon than it is from lithium well let's go back to our little cartoons that we used in an earlier video here's lithium and here's neon not really drawn to scale of course but you can see that in both of these they have two occupied energy levels so distance it's not really the deal that's not really the the factor that's causing that what do you notice that really is different about them it's the nucleus this lithium atom has only three protons this neon atom has 10 protons over three times as many so is the factor the charge or is it the distance back from our discussion about Coulomb's law well it's the charge isn't it and so that's why uh it's so much more difficult to take that electron away from neon and this shows something called effective nuclear charge and that's basically a measure of how well or how effectively those protons in this case neon how those protons are pulling in those electrons in the electron cloud I'm kind of fond of saying that in chemistry protons don't do a whole lot in fact we don't talk about protons very often really the only job that protons have is to keep the electrons from flying away and as we can see neon has a whole lot more protons and so it's going to be a whole lot more effective at keeping those electrons from flying away so it will have a very effective a very high effective nuclear charge lithium not so much so as we talk about the first ionization energy this is the trend here it's kind of cut off at the bottom but I think you can figure out what it's saying we were comparing lithium which is over here to Neon which is over here so what's the reason well this kind of a cheat sheet here this shows you that neon has a greater effective nuclear charge than lithium you know if you're talking about left and right you want to discuss greater or lesser effective nuclear charge as being the reason if you're talking about up and down that's when you talk about electron distance now let's let's talk about successive ionization energies in calcium so what this means is to take away the first electron for calcium it's going to require about 589.8 kilojoules per mole the second one is about 1145 and the third one is 49 12. I want you to notice that there seems to be a huge jump in here somewhere can you tell where the huge jump is do you see that the big jump is from the second to the Third you know here from the first to second that's like you know twice as much but then from the second to the third that's well over four times almost five times as high and then from the third to the fourth it's not that much of a jump at all so since there's a huge jump from the second to the third what that's telling us is that this atom has two valence electrons and if you look at your periodic table you'll see that indeed calcium does have two valence electrons and that means that to remove that third electron that third ionization energy that means we're going beyond the valence electrons into the what are called The Core electrons and that requires a whole lot more energy than valence electrons now with data like this we can actually predict what type or what element it could be so let's take a look at this little graph here this table and let's predict which of these four elements we're looking at here if this is the data so the first thing you want to do is find where the huge jump is so can you look at this table here and see where the huge jump is do you see that it's from the third to the fourth right there it goes up by what is that well over four times I believe almost four times anyway these others are not nearly as as large of a jump in magnitude so that tells us that this has how many valence electrons it's got to have three three valence electrons because from the third to the fourth that means the fourth that's your core so three valence electrons so we're looking for one of these four choices that has three valence electrons which one is it well hope you realize that it is Aluminum you can look at your periodic table and see that aluminum is the one that has three valence electrons I hope you learned something about ionization energy we're going to continue with this and talk more about it in the next couple videos so stay tuned keep watching and I hope you are learning chemistry,"4,568",0,9
"Periodic Trends: Atomic Radius & Ionic Radius - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 7b","In this video, Mr. Krug shares the second in a series of three lessons about periodic trends, focusing on atomic radius and ionic radius.  He uses Coulomb's Law to show how to predict the relative sizes of atoms and ions on the periodic table.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uaub18RkAA&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=10,we're moving on with unit 1 Section 7 in this second video this time we're going to be focusing on radius and atomic radius ionic radius of atoms and how they compare to each other now this is our little cheat sheet that we had earlier where we have effective nuclear charge if we're comparing atoms that are you know left and right across from each other and if it's up and down we're going to talk about electron distance so if we want to Define what atomic radius is it's the average distance from the nucleus to the outermost part of the electron cloud now if we want to compare these two right here here we have magnesium and barium which one is going to have the larger atomic radius well it would be the one that has more occupied energy levels so it's barium so the ones toward the bottom of the table have the larger atomic radius the ones toward the top of the table usually have the smaller radius now if we're comparing atoms that are left and right across from each other like potassium and Krypton well the ones toward the right have a greater effective nuclear charge and are able to pull in those electrons more tightly so the ones on the right like Krypton are going to be smaller and then the ones on the left like potassium are going to be larger now they say that a picture is worth a thousand words here is a graphical representation of what that would look like more or less drawn to scale so here we have the representative elements and their atomic radii in picometers and so as you can see the largest atoms tend to be toward the the bottom left like CCM and rubidium and barium over here and the smallest atoms tend to be toward the top and especially the top right like helium and neon of course hydrogen is much smaller you know all these over here in the top and right those will be the smallest and so that may help you to remember the relative values of the atomic radii now let's do some explaining here because this is something that the College Board likes to ask on their exam let's use atomic structure to explain why the atomic radius of lithium is larger than the atomic radius of fluorine so once again here's lithium and here's fluorine much smaller less than half the size so why is it well remember our cheat sheet our graphic shows that if it's left and right we need to talk about what's that factor effective nuclear charge so we would say that you know both of these atoms have two occupied energy levels however since fluorine has many more protons than lithium fluorine has a greater effective nuclear charge so what's the result of that well that means that fluorine is going to have a greater force of attraction between the nucleus and its electron cloud able and it's able to pull in those electrons more tightly and make its atomic radius much smaller than is the case for lithium so that's how you'd answer that question now let's try this question use atomic structure to explain why the atomic radius of iodine is larger than the atomic radius of chlorine so let's go back to our graphic here here's iodine and here's chlorine iodine is more than 30 percent larger than chlorine so why is that the case well think back to our graphic and our cheat sheet there if it's top and bottom we need to think about this in terms of electron distance right and the the fact that we have more occupied energy levels in the ones that are farther down so here's what you want to say that the valence electrons for iodine are in the fifth occupied energy level while the valence electrons for chlorine are in the third occupied energy level so that means that the distance from the outermost electrons to the nucleus is a whole lot greater in iodine than it is in chlorine because you have basically more electron shells more occupied energy levels so there we have atomic radius now here's our graphic again remember this will help us to figure out the reasoning if you're talking about atomic radius of course you want to talk about this in terms of electron shells you're going up and down effective nuclear charge for left and right now how about ionic radius this is a little bit different because when atoms gain electrons right we know that electrons have a negative charge when they gain electrons they they gain a negative charge and so they become ions so when we go through that process or when atoms go through that process they become larger anions are always larger than the atoms from which they are derived so just as an example here's fluorine this is not drawn to scale but you can kind of get the idea here if we toss in another electron here and now we have F negative notice how the ionic radius changed it went up almost a double to what it was before so why is that the case we only added in one electron why is the radius so much larger well think about it in terms of the electrons if you have more electrons you have more electron electron repulsion right electrons repel each other so that means that they're going to try to spread out farther from each other so here's your explanation the fluoride ion has more electrons than the fluorine atom so it's even though they have the same number of protons so we have the greater electron electron repulsions in fluorine that are going to allow those electrons to spread out farther and as you can see it's a big factor here now what about positive ions cations well those are the opposite anytime you have an atom that loses electrons and becomes a cation well that cation is always going to be smaller than the atom from which it was derived so here's sodium for example sodium has 11 electrons if you take away that last electron right there here's what's going to happen to it it gets a whole lot smaller a lot smaller as you can see so once again y I bet some of you can probably just look at this and and see that we have lost an entire electron shell haven't we that third occupied energy level is gone because that was the only electron that was in it so we've lost an entire energy level and it also has to do with the fact that we now have more protons than electrons in our our cation here so we have a greater or a more effective nuclear charge and so take a look at that answer there it says that sodium the sodium atom that is has more electrons and more occupied energy levels than the sodium cation even though you have the same number of protons the sodium ion has its outermost electron in the second occupied energy level while sodium the atom has its outermost electrons and the third occupied energy level so there's a certainly more repulsion more electron electron repulsion over here than there is over here imagine it if you will like a tug of war over here in this left example it's tied we have 11 protons and 11 electrons so it's tied over here in the ion we have 11 protons and only 10 electrons so the protons are winning and so they're able to pull in those electrons more effectively like I said in an earlier video the only job that protons have is to keep the electrons from flying away and here in the ion they're doing a much more effective job at that now once again here's a graphic to help us see how that works in almost every case the negative ion is larger than the positive ion and one thing that you might notice is that the more positive the charge the smaller the radius and so we can use that to help us make some predictions as we go forward so let's compare these two ions right here that we've just discussed the sodium cation on the left over here and then we have the fluoride anion on the right and we can see what happens to the electrons here we had that electron configuration it loses one electron to become 1s2 2s2 to P6 and then fluoride was like this and it's going to gain one electron to become 1s2 2s2 2p6 so you might notice that these two ions actually have the same electron configuration now when that happens we say that these two species these two things here are isoelectronic now that's just a fancy word that means they have the same electron configuration same electron configuration so if that's the case Y is the sodium cation so much smaller than the fluoride anion well you probably know if you've been watching these videos so far you know it's not really going to have a whole lot to do with those electrons as it does with the protons that nuclear charge and if we throw that into the mix here we see that there are 11 protons in the sodium cation so the protons are winning that tug of war they're able to pull in those those electrons much more tightly over here with the fluoride anion looks like the electrons are winning and so they're able to spread out and get as far or actually farther apart from that nucleus so that's the nuclear charge part of this so we have a couple questions which of the following species is not isoelectronic with Krypton so for a question like this your your periodic table comes in handy and we know that Krypton has 36 electrons and so if we just look at our table we can see that the one that would not have 36 electrons is the potassium ion you know k it normally has 19 electrons but since it's lost one with the plus one charge it would have 18. so that's why potassium is the answer on this the uh you know sometimes they'll toss that onto an AP exam a question like this about this rank the following species in order from smallest to largest in size so notice that they're all versions of fluorine and One giveaway here is that you might remember that the one that's the positive or the most positively charged is the smallest and likewise the one that's the most negatively charged is the largest and so the easy way to do this is just you know the one that's the smallest is the most positively charged which is the f plus and then just how regular fluorine would be next and then F negative is next and the largest one is the ion that has the most negative charge which is F2 negative so that's how we can rank those species let's try another one let's arrange these following ions in order of increasing size so once again we might take a just take a quick look at our periodic table here and notice that all four of these are isoelectronic with each other they all have 18 electrons so that means that we can just assume that the one that's smallest is going to be the one that's the most positively charged so that would be calcium so calcium two plus is going to be the the smallest and then we have a K plus that's slightly less positively charged now we have a negative one and then the largest is going to be the one that's the most negatively charged which is S2 negative which also happens to be the one that has the fewest protons that's the reason that's the case so here we're able to arrange these in order of increasing size I hope you've learned something about atomic radius and ionic radius in this video please give me a thumbs up if you liked the video or at least learn something from this and I hope to see you in the third video over unit 1 Section 7.,"3,155",0,10
"Periodic Trends: Electronegativity - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 7c","In this video, Mr. Krug shares the last in a series of three videos about periodic trends, focusing on electronegativity.  He shows students how to use Coulomb's Law and various properties of atoms to predict the relative electronegativity of atoms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2aGKh_4HGI&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=11,in this third video over unit 1 Section 7 we're going to be focusing on more periodic trends this time specifically electronegativity now electronegativity is a measure of how well an atom can attract an electron so let's compare these two atoms right here magnesium and chlorine so which one of those is going to attract an electron more effectively well let's think about what's going on here chlorine has more protons than magnesium it has a greater effective nuclear charge as you might remember in our graphic from the last video and as a result since it has greater effective nuclear charge it can attract electrons in much better so higher electronegativity on the other hand magnesium over here has fewer protons so it's going to have a lower effective nuclear charge a lower electronegativity so let's compare these two fluorine and iodine well remember when we're talking about up and down we need to be thinking about this in terms of the distance from the electrons to the nucleus here in iodine we have more occupied energy levels which means we have a greater distance from the nucleus to those outermost electrons which means it can't attract in those electrons from farther away so a lower electronegativity on the other hand fluorine has fewer occupied energy levels so as a result there's a smaller distance from the nucleus to those last electrons so we'd say it has a higher electronegativity so once again here is here's that cheat sheet again except I've I've put in electronegativity this time it's higher generally speaking as you go to the top and to the right and it's lower as you go toward the left end to the bottom as you can see here so those are the same reasons that we talked about earlier just as a side note normally we don't talk about the electronegativity of the noble gases those technically they do have in electronegativity but we don't worry about those we kind of just focus on the others fluorine just so you know has the highest electronegativity of all the elements the lowest of course will be down here with francium and cesium and in that area now let's backtrack a bit and talk about first ionization energy we talked about this two videos ago in the section 7 first video part A there and we said that the first ionization energy is the amount of energy that's required to remove the very last electron in an atom that's the least tightly held electron the one that's farthest away so let's compare these two we have magnesium and we have Argon can you tell me which one has the greater first ionization energy I hope you're thinking it's argon right and we know that it's farther to the right but don't say that as the reasoning you want to say why it's got more protons greater effective nuclear charge if you're comparing right and left talk about greater effective nuclear charge so it's got the higher first ionization energy on the other hand magnesium has fewer protons as a result a lower effective nuclear charge and a lower first ionization energy now let's compare top and bottom let's compare helium with Xenon now both of these have a have a pretty high first ionization energy but which one is higher now we hopefully you remember the graphic and know that helium being higher up is going to have the higher first ionization energy now Xenon is lower why well more occupied energy levels which means there's a greater distance from the nucleus to those outermost electrons so it's going to be easier to remove that last electron lower first ionization energy helium is the opposite you've got fewer electron shells occupied energy levels so the distance from the nucleus to those last electrons will be much smaller so higher first ionization energy so hopefully at this point you've learned uh the reasons and we've hopefully seen lots of examples of that so here is the graphic again that's one that you want to to try to remember as much as you can left and right you want to talk about effective nuclear charge top and bottom you want to talk about number of occupied energy levels and electron distance so let's wrap it up here by answering this question using principles of atomic structure explain why the first ionization energy of sulfur is lower than that of oxygen so if you take out your periodic table you'll see that oxygen is higher up on the table sulfur is just underneath it so you want to talk about this in terms of occupied energy levels and electron distance so that's going to be the reasoning so you want to say that the valence electrons in Sulfur are farther away they occupy a higher shell or a higher uh energy level than those in oxygen so that means that the distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons is is farther it's greater in Sulfur than it is in oxygen so what's going on here well that greater distance or that greater separation in Sulfur means that we're going to have weaker coulombic attractions that means weaker attractions between protons and electrons and that means that in Sulfur your outermost electrons are less tightly bound and it's easier to remove them compared to what you have in oxygen so that's how you would want to to explain this you want to make your claim make your evidence or give some evidence and then give the relevance or explain why it matters that's where you close the deal we'll talk more about this as we write more essays and practice this later thanks for watching this is the third in a fairly major section of unit one join me in my next video for unit 1 Section 8.,"2,586",0,11
"Valence Electrons & Ionic Compounds - AP Chem Unit 1, Topic 8","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses the pattern of valence electrons found on the periodic table and shows how this pattern can be used to predict the properties of ionic compounds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tWZl3-_ZZU&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=12,here in unit 1 Section 8 we're going to wrap up our discussion of atomic structure by looking at some more patterns on the periodic table now if you've taken a first year chemistry class you've probably learned about some of these before our first pattern that we're going to look at is the pattern of valence electrons for representative elements on the periodic table and if you took first year chemistry you might remember that all these elements in group 1 over here have one valence electron and likewise in group two they all have two valence electrons Group 13 right here they'll all have three valence electrons group 14 they have four and it kind of goes on like that group 15 has five group 16 has six Group 17 has seven group eight except for helium of course will have eight valence electrons in fact anything that has eight valence electrons we call that an octet and we'll talk more about that in unit two so that is a pattern that you want to keep in mind now because of those valence electrons this also uh leads into a pattern of ionic charges for the ions of those representative elements and so as you look at the table that tells us that pretty much all these ions of Group 1 elements are going to have a charge of positive one and all the ions of the group two elements will be positive two and a lot of these Group 13 elements will have positive three charges if we go from the other side of the table the halogens will pretty much all make ions that have a negative one charge and most of your oxygen group elements will make ions that have a negative two charge and a lot of your group 15 elements over here the ones that start with nitrogen group there those will generally make a negative three charge and so that's a pattern you can can predict that based on the periodic table now because of this very predictable pattern and the fact that so many of these elements in the same group share the same charge they're often going to make compounds that behave very similar to each other so for example if we think of group two oxides I just chose three of these here kind of at random we have calcium and magnesium and strontium oxides here all three of those metals are in group two and if you look at these three solids chemically they're actually rather similar to each other now of course there are some differences and we'll talk about that as we move through this course but generally speaking if you look at them how they behave chemically pretty close to each other chemically and that's because they have these same groups you have the calcium strontium magnesium they're all in the same group so they're going to behave very similar to each other chemically now let's wrap this up by talking about the difference in these electrons here are some terms that we've used already but let's just kind of get a definition there when we talk about valence electrons but those are the electrons in the outermost occupied energy level of an atom the core electrons are all the others those are your electrons in the the inside energy levels so so we talk about valence electrons a lot because those are the ones that are doing something those are the electrons that get donated or shared or or something in a reaction core electrons don't do a whole lot now if we go back to our PES diagram that we looked at earlier in this unit we can see that the valence electrons are bound much less tightly to the nucleus than the core electrons are in fact we know that the 4S electrons these these right here those your valence electrons and notice how small that number is compared to the others point nine seven nine I'm going to leave off the the exponent there we'll just say 0.979 and compare that to the others that's about you know one-fourth of the energy that's required to to take away these three p electrons it's about four times larger over here in some cases if you want to compare your valence electrons to the 1s electrons those are very close in to the nucleus we're talking about those electrons are bound hundreds of times over 600 times more tightly look at that energy there so yeah those valence electrons are bound with much less energy than the core electrons are as a result it's a whole lot easier to remove valence electrons from an atom than it is to pull those core electrons away my name is Jeremy Krug I hope you've enjoyed this unit one complete course discussion here in AP Chemistry Hope you join me for unit two I'll be seeing you soon thanks for watching,"2,511",0,12
"Types of Chemical Bonds - AP Chem Unit 2, Topic 1","In this video, Mr. Krug describes the differences between ionic and covalent bonds, also highlighting how polar and nonpolar covalent bonds are different from each other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQk9E_Y2EWw&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=13,we start unit 2 by looking at types of chemical bonds now the first type of bond I have have up here is called a covalent bond and this is what you have generally speaking when two non-metals that is two elements generally speaking from the the right side of the periodic table are sharing electrons so here we have an example of this we have iodine and it's uh seven valence electrons and we have chlorine over here with its seven valence electrons and you know as we've learned in previous lessons each of these atoms would really be more stable Having Eight valence electrons having that nice stable octet well what they can do is they can get together like this and they can take this electron right here and that electron right there and share them in the middle that way both of these atoms can lay claim to both of those valence electrons in the middle so we have a shared electron pair and this is a good example of a covalent bond two non-metals sharing a pair of electrons now when we think about the energy behind this when you have two atoms like in this top example that are fairly far apart and they really haven't gotten the chance to share their electrons yet we'll say that those two atoms have a higher potential energy state in other words we can say that they have a high potential to get together and form a bond over here though in this state we have a lower potential energy State and normally whenever you have two atoms that are forming a chemical bond that distance between them is going to be the lowest potential energy state that is available we'll talk more about that in a future lesson in this course but for right now we can say that when these atoms are far apart and they're not bonding they have a higher potential energy when they're closer together and they are bonding they have that lower potential energy state and whenever we draw this structure we take that shared pair that's in the middle and we replace it with a line that line represents the fact that we have a covalent chemical bond there so when you see that line or sometimes two lines that would mean a double bond or three lines right like in that same spot would be a triple bond we'll see some examples of that here shortly so if we have a chemical bond like this that's what we call a nonpolar covalent bond when you have iodine and sulfur bonding these two electrons it's a bond where we have the two nonmetals and they're shearing electrons equally or almost equally and we have a lot of chemical bonds that do that on the other hand we have some pairs of nonmetals like carbon and fluorine where they're not sharing very equally in fact they're sharing rather unequally one of the atoms is hogging the electrons so the way I sometimes think about this is in this first example you have two non-metals and they're sharing those electrons equally they're really good at sharing so you know they're sharing and sharing is a good thing so they're you know they're happy they're like little angels there got the Halo there and so they're good at sharing they're sharing pretty much equally there are some people that are like that they're very good at sharing on the other hand we have this set down here you know where fluorine is basically hogging the electrons and plural carbon Harley hardly gets to use those electrons whereas up here it's pretty much a 50 50 split maybe 60 40 but it is pretty close to even now because of the fact that fluorine is hogging the electrons well carbon is sad because it doesn't get to use the electrons it thought it was going to be sharing whereas fluorine well it is I'm not much of I'm not very good at drawing these Hogs here but you can imagine we have some kind of electron hog here and that's kind of what's going on so fluorine is hogging the electrons that's what happens in a polar covalent bond one of the atoms is hogging the electrons now the question is how do I know how do I know that fluorine is the electron hog and it's not carbon or how do I know that in this pair up here iodine and sulfur are sharing those electrons fairly equally well it comes down to something that we learned at the end of unit one and that's called the electronegativity now every atom on the periodic table has an electronegativity since we're talking about covalent bonds I'm just showing you the examples of the electronegativities of the non-metals here or most of the non-metals but if you look at the difference in the electronegativity of the atoms that are in the in the structure you can see if it's a polar or a nonpolar Bond so in that other example let me just pull that up here we had iodine and sulfur so if we look at iodine it's electricity it's electronegativity is about 2.5 sulfur is 2.5 so they're the same so that is pretty much a perfectly non-polar chemical bond those two atoms are sharing those electrons equally 50 50 sharing if you have a pair of atoms where the difference is less than about 0.5 or so we can call that nonpolar covalent now it might be the fact that the one that with the higher electronegativity is hogging them just a little bit but there's a Continuum here so as long as the difference is less than about 0.5 we'll go ahead and call it nonpolar covalent if that difference in the two atoms electronegativity is 0.5 or greater we'll call it polar covalent and of course the one that has the higher electronegativity is the one that's hogging those electrons a little bit more and as a result on the side of that atom whichever one it might be whichever one has the higher electronegativity there's a slight slightly negative charge a partial negative charge on that part of the bond the other one that's not hogging those electrons one with the lower electronegativity would have a slightly partial positive charge there in that part of the bond if you ever see a pair of atoms that's a metal and a non-metal you know one from the left side one from the right side that's going to be an ionic chemical bond now let's try some examples here let's try Boron and chlorine so we can look at the table here Boron is a 2.0 chlorine is a 3.0 so that difference between the two is 1.0 so it's certainly greater than 0.5 so it's going to be a polar covalent bond and chlorine is the one that's hogging the electrons a little bit more since it's more electronegative how about carbon and hydrogen well we can look at the chart carbon is 2.5 hydrogen is 2.1 so the difference between those two is 0.4 and that's less than 0.5 isn't it so we can call that nonpolar covalent now it's not perfectly nonpolar is it we know that you know the the carbon has a little bit higher electronegativity so it's it may be hogging those electrons just a little bit but not a lot it might be a 60 40 sharing Arrangement instead of a perfect 50 50. now how about sodium and bromine well notice that sodium is not on the chart at all because sodium is a metal you can see that on your copy of the periodic table so this is a metal and a non-metal so we're going to call that ionic and in ionic chemical bonds the metal is generally transferring those electrons to the nonmetal now we're going to take a look at another kind of bonding and this is called metallic bonding and this is what you have when you have a metal like a chunk of iron or a chunk of gold or an alloy perhaps of bronze or steel or something like that now in these metallic elements in these Metals electrons have quite a bit of freedom of motion they're able to move fairly freely instead of being stuck to the nucleus from which they came so here's an example of that here's what you might have in the case of a metal or perhaps an alloy of some sort we have these metallic nuclei and they're they're pretty much fixed in place although metals are fairly malleable and ductile but for the most part there's solids and they're they're pretty much in their position but the electrons are essentially able to move around they're what we might call a bit delocalized and so they're able to move around and flow and that actually explains why metals and metallic Alloys as well are so good at conducting electricity because electricity is the movement of electrons through a wire basically and so if to have electricity you have to have these electrons that are able to move around freely and that's how that works this brings us to the end of lesson two section one hope you like the video join me

"Energy, Ionic Solids, Metals, & Alloys - AP Chem Unit 2, Topics 2-4","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses how bond length, atomic distance, and potential energy are related.  Students will learn how to find the relationship between charge, ionic size, and the melting point for ionic compounds.  He also focuses on ionic compounds and shows how ionic solids are arranged.  He concludes the video with a discussion of metallic bonding and the two main types of alloys - substitutional and interstitial.  00:00  Unit 2, Topic 2 13:42  Unit 2, Topic 3 17:07  Unit 2, Topic 4",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buRAe2IDBzQ&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=14,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and welcome back to AP Chemistry we're in unit 2 section 2 here where we're learning about uh the energy between two atoms we're going to look at ionic bonding as well and the metallic bonding so we have a graph here and this shows the potential energy between two atoms in this case of chlorine as they get closer to each other and farther apart and so generally speaking the way this works is the bond length is going to be the distance where the potential between the two atoms is at its lowest so you might remember that from the last video we talked about when the atoms are farther apart they have higher potential energy when they're closer together and actually forming a bond they have the low the lowest potential energy so this is an actual graph of that so can you look at this graph and tell me what the bond length is actually going to be well the answer is it's going to be the length the internuclear distance where the graph hits its lowest point which is 200 picometers so that's the bond length here at 200 picometers now what if someone asked you what's the bond enthalpy or the bond energy between these two atoms well it is the energy where it hits that lowest spot so it's going to be 200 about 250 kilojoules per mole now some students might wonder well why is it not negative 250 kilojoules per mole well this a negative here represents the energy that's released when the two atoms are forming that chemical bond forming chemical bonds will always be an exothermic process that's why it's a negative number there on the other hand the bond enthalpy refers to how much energy it's it's going to require to break that bonds that's why it's it's the opposite sign Bond enthalpy is always going to be a positive number so that's why it's 250 kilojoules per mole in this case now let's take a look at ionic bonding as we've learned before it's a metal and a non-metal that form an ionic bond and so let's take a look at probably one of our favorite ionic bonds the one that's formed between sodium and chlorine and we know that sodium if you look at its electron configuration has one valence electron that 3s1 electron is the one valence electron in the third occupy the energy level on the other hand chlorine has seven valence electrons it has seven because we have 3s2 and 3p5 those are the seven electrons in its last occupied energy level so now we know that sodium is going to tend to lose an electron and it's going to be able to give that electron to sodium so it's going to donate that electron and when that happens we're now going to have new electron configurations sodium is going to have have this octet right here and chlorine is going to have this nice octet state and this is what we're going to have we'll have two ions sodium will now be a positive cation and chlorine is going to be a negative anion now we know that when they're farther apart like this just like we said they're in the higher potential energy State and as they form the bond like this they get close together to form that Bond now they're in a lower potential energy state so farther apart is higher energy closer together in the bond is the lower potential energy State now the reason this works is because after the sodium the metal in this case donates electrons to the non-metal the chlorine in this case we now have opposite charges and as you probably already know from other science classes opposite charges attract now in chemistry this is something we call electrostatic attractions the positives are going to attract negative charges electrostatic attractions and because of these very strong electrostatic attractions ionic bonds are about as strong a chemical bond as you can get with some very few exceptions so take a look at this one here sodium and fluorine make a sodium fluoride compound with a plus one minus one charge there and it has a very high melting point almost a thousand degrees Celsius that's a very strong bond there and how about magnesium with fluorine well you know that's mg plus two and two F negatives and it's even stronger look at its melting point it's well over 1200 degrees Celsius and how about this one here we have aluminum with three fluorine atoms making the aluminum fluoride compound Al has a plus three charge and that's balanced out by three of these fluoride negative ions and guess what it's melting points even higher almost 1 300 degrees Celsius to melt that now you might notice that there seems to be a pattern here there is an ascending melting point now why is that the case well it has to do with the fact that when the magnitude of the charge increases the melting point increases now you might remember that this is an application of Coulomb's law that we learned back in unit one so as we see in this case here sodium chloride it's got a plus one minus 1 charge differential it has a melting point of about 801 degrees Celsius but watch what happens when we bump it up to a plus two minus 2 charge attraction we're right at 2 000 degrees Celsius very high now what do you think is going to happen if we have a plus 3 negative 3 charge differential it's going to go even higher isn't it and that's what happens when you have something like aluminum phosphide plus three minus three look at how high that melting point is well over 2 500 degrees Celsius now because of this we can actually predict the relative melting points of compounds by looking at the charges in the ionic compound so in this example here which of the following compounds would have the higher melting point lithium chloride or magnesium chloride well look at the charges lithium and chlorine are plus one negative one aren't they whereas magnesium chloride would be plus two negative one so we have a higher charge differential on this one so magnesium chloride has the higher melting point if you don't believe me of course you can look it up online Google it or look it up in the chemical literature and you'll see that the melting point of magnesium chloride is well over 100 degrees Celsius higher than lithium chloride so that's one way to predict relative melting points now what do you do if the charges of the ions are the same let's say that you have three compounds three ionic compounds and they're all plus one minus one so let's take a look at these here we have some cases like that here's lithium fluoride plus one minus one and there's its melting point here's sodium chloride plus one minus one there's its melting point and here's potassium bromide and there's its melting point do you notice a hierarchy in this one hopefully you notice that it comes down to not the charge in this case but it is the ionic size melting point decreases as ionic size increases hopefully that makes sense as well that's the D part of Coulomb's law there was a q which was for charge this is the D for distance because for example in this in this last example potassium bromide those ions are so far apart they're not able to attract each other as much and so they're they're attraction to each other is just lower and so it's easier to melt that compound whereas lithium fluoride those ions are much closer to each other and so they have a stronger attraction it doesn't it actually requires more energy to to melt that compound so once again when you have these ionic nuclei that are farther apart from each other the attractive forces between them get weaker so if you're asked to predict the relative melting points of ionic compounds the first thing you want to look at will be the charges larger charge magnitude means higher melting point if it's a tie if they have the same charge then you look at the size that's the tie breaker so let's take a look at lattice energy here that is the energy that's released when the ions are combined into this ionic compound generally speaking the stronger the force you're going to have more energy released so in that last example we had lithium fluoride and look at look at that well over a thousand kilojoules per mole that is released whenever you have that compound formed sodium chloride the ions are larger so there's not as much of an attraction and so not quite as much energy is released and then the potassium bromide those were the big ones right those were the largest ions and so look at that they have the least energy associated with their lattice energy now let's go and predict the melting points so let's try this one first aluminum fluoride versus magnesium chloride which one has the higher melting point well once again take a look at the charges the the actual charge differential here so think about the fact that in aluminum fluoride we're talking about a plus three and a minus one versus a plus two and a minus one so because of that the aluminum fluoride has the higher melting point how about this one once again look at the charges sodium is a plus one Pro means a minus one whereas calcium is a plus two and oxides a minus two so a large charger or larger charge differential over here so calcium oxide is going to have the higher melting point look at those charges let's try this one here strontium bromide or calcium fluoride well once again look at the charge differential there this is a plus two minus one calcium is a plus two fluorides minus one so the charge isn't going to tell us is it so what's the tie breaker it's the ionic size so use your periodic table to find the relative sizes of those and you'll find that strontium and bromide are farther down on the periodic table than calcium and fluoride so that means that these two over here are larger ions weaker Force these are smaller ions so stronger Force so calcium fluoride will have the higher melting point let's try one more let's try calcium chloride versus sodium oxide now in this one we have a plus two minus one charge differential and here we have a plus one minus two so basically the same so the charge isn't going to tell us so once again we have to look at the ionic size so refer to your periodic table and when you do that you'll find that calcium and chlorine are farther down on the table so larger ions mean weaker Force it's going to be a lower melting point over here we have you know they're higher up on the table so that means that they're going to have smaller radius and they're going to have stronger tractions higher melting point so that's why sodium oxide is the answer for that one so higher melting point you can predict that using the charge and the ionic size now let's take a look at this question in which of these two metallic chlorides would you have the higher melting points well flea you can see that it's not going to come down to charge because everything is a one-to-one ratio here so it's not the charge that that's doing anything it's the radius and so as we said the ones that have the smaller radius are going to have stronger attractions so that means that the chloride on the right we'll have the higher melting point you can take a look at the explanation here as we see here the ions or the ion centers are closer to each other in this second compound so those ionic attractions are going to be stronger so that's how we can justify this by looking at the picture there now we're going to jump right into section 2.3 because this is is very similar to 2.2 we're going to look at ionic bonds now ionic bonds produce ionic compounds there are some properties that you need to know about ionic compounds they have a relatively high melting point in those last few slides we saw that these melting points are in the hundreds if not thousands of degrees that's pretty high and they're going to be brittle when they're hit so if you take a crystal of salt for example I think you know that if you hit it with a hammer or Mallet it's going to shatter it's not like it's going to hammer out into a nice thin sheet they're not malleable at all now later in this course we'll actually talk about why that is usually ionic compounds if you can dissolve them in water will conduct electricity and that's because they have these positive and negative charges so when you dissolve them you have these charged particles swimming around in the water and that's able to conduct electricity that's why we call these ionic compounds electrolytes and so when you see a ionic compound it is an electrolyte usually they're soluble in polar solvents now we'll talk more about what a polar solvent is here in a couple of videos but the best polar solvent or the most common one at least is water so most ionic compounds are soluble in water at least a little bit and we'll talk more about that here in a couple of units normally ionic compounds have a very orderly repeating crystal structure called a crystal lattice and if we were to actually zoom in on this using a scanning tunneling microscope it is actually possible to see the individual atoms and so here we have an ionic compound where we can actually see the anions those are the larger little objects here and then the cations are the smaller ones that are kind of interspersed there so we can see that beautiful repeating crystal lattice as we look at the actual ionic compounds now you need to realize that ionic compounds do not exist in individual molecules it's not like water where there's an H2O floating around over here independently and there's another H2O floating around independently over here and then there's another one over here that's not how it is with ionic compounds instead they have that repeating three-dimensional crystal lattice and that lattice like we said earlier is held together by electrostatic forces so in the case of sodium chloride as an example this is what you might see or something like that of course this is a nice pretty picture but that's the basic idea there we would have a sodium and then a chlorine and a sodium and a chlorine this is a very orderly repeating crystal lattice and you would be expected to know that the sodium ion would be the smaller one because cations are normally smaller aren't they so the purple ones would be the sodiums and the green ones which are a little bit larger would be the chloride ions section 2.4 and talk about metals and how those work we talked about those a little earlier but we'll talk about those some more here now we said earlier that metals do not have the electrons basically Frozen or or stuck to the individual atoms those electrons are able to move around fairly freely and so we say that those electrons are delocalized so here's that picture again that we saw in unit 2 Section 1 where we have those nuclei that are in that fairly orderly pattern but then the electrons are delocalized they're able to move around and that is why why electricity flows through metals and metallic Alloys it's kind of like we have these positively charged nuclei in what we sometimes call it a sea of electrons because these electrons are like a c they're able to flow freely and move around and that's what makes electricity essentially in a wire at least you have electrons that are able to flow freely through that wire so this is a good explanation of why metal elements and metal alloys do conduct electricity now let's take a look at metallic alloys there are two important types the first one is called substitutional Alloys and most of the Alloys that you've heard of are substitutional Alloys like brass and bronze and and pewter and sterling silver and things like that those are going to be substitutional so in brass you may have a main element like copper for example but there's a pretty good amount of zinc as well and so what will happen is the zinc will actually substitute into the spots where some of those copper atoms would normally be and so that's why we call this a substitutional alloy different different elements or atoms of different elements we'll actually substitute into the lattice right there substitutional Alloys now another type of alloy is called interstitial Alloys now the most common example of this is steel and the way interstitial Alloys work is you have little smaller atoms that stick into the spaces between the atoms what are called the interstitial spaces and they act essentially as a hardening agent to keep these different layers from from slipping they're able to to be basically stuck in place it acts as a hardening agent and so in the case of Steel the main element is iron and so these little black circles are basically atoms of iron but in Iron if you add carbon to it you make steel and so these little red circles would be examples of carbon atoms that are actually getting into the interstitial spaces acting as a hardening agent now different types of Steel have different amounts of carbon and different amounts of other elements as well that give it different properties and so I'm not going to say that there's a very specific just one recipe for making steel there are lots of different types depending upon the type of Steel that you need well here we've just covered sections 2.2 2.3 and 2.4 hope you've enjoyed the video give me a thumbs up if you learned something and join me in the next

"Lewis Electron-Dot Diagrams - AP Chem Unit 2, Topic 5A","In this video, Mr. Krug shows how to draw Lewis electron-dot diagrams, working through several examples in the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lFg4z0OOOY&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=15,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we are looking at unit 2 for Section 5 which is about how we can actually simulate the shape of a molecule and draw a picture that represents what its shape is actually going to look like now the method that we do this is called Lewis electron dot diagrams and we're going to use the valence electrons that each atom has around the symbols of the atoms to try to figure out what they look like so we'll try a simple example here like this one here and we're going to actually draw the the structure of that so the first thing you want to do is use your periodic table to figure out how many valence electrons each of these atoms has now fluorine as you can see on your table it's in group 17. so it has seven valence electrons you want to draw those seven valence electrons around the symbol there in in the form of dots I always try to pair up as many of these dots as you can so we draw the seven dots just just like that now the chlorine as you look at your periodic table as well you can see that it's also in group 17 it's halogen so it has seven valence electrons too so I'm going to draw those seven dots around the chlorine just like this once again trying to pair everything up as much as I can and I notice that I have a pair here in the middle that can be shared very easily so this shared pair is going to form a covalent bond and so whenever you draw the Lewis electron dot diagram for this molecule it's going to look something like this where we have you know these unshared pairs that are just kind of around the outside there but you want to draw this shared pair in the middle there as a line that represents the fact that we have a covalent bond specifically a single Bond okay now this is a a simple example we're going to work our way up to some that are a little bit more difficult now before we do that we need to realize that in order to draw these diagrams we're going to be following the octet rule and the octet rule tells us that most atoms are more stable when they have eight valence electrons so in that last example we had the two atoms started out with seven but they ended up with eight because eight is a more stable conformation than having seven or six or some other number now we know that atoms are going to do lots of things they will donate electrons they will steal electrons they will share electrons in order to get that ideal conformation of eight valence electrons that octet so in these covalent compounds they're generally going to be sharing but if it's ionic they can donate steel something like that now there are some exceptions to the octet rule that you need to know about before we even talk about the big exceptions in our following video hydrogen of course is a major exception it only has one occupied energy level and that energy level only holds two electrons so hydrogen is not striving for eight it's striving for two and so hydrogen is stable with just two electrons so that's that that's the big exception also Boron Boron more often than not will tend to be more stable with six electrons just because of the way it the way it seems to bond every now and then Boron will have eight but usually you'll find that it ends up with six so that's just a just an exception to be on the lookout for now a major exception that we'll be looking at in our next video is non-metals that have three or more energy levels so that would be on the periodic table that would be the non-metals in Period three and Beyond so things like phosphorus or sulfur or chlorine you know tellurium something like that those non-metals can sometimes go over eight they will sometimes have more than eight valence electrons they can go up to 10 or 12. and we'll see some examples of that in the next video that's called an expanded octet which is kind of a bad name for it it's not really an octet at all it actually goes beyond eight so it's it's it's going to be something that we'll see in our next video let's go back to the octet rule though and do some examples let's try carbon tetrachloride now on most of these Lewis electron dot diagrams you're going to have an atom that is in the middle of the structure and then all the other atoms are surrounding it now hopefully you can see that the central atom here is going to be carbon so when you draw the structure put carbon in the middle and draw those other four chlorine atoms surrounding it usually at right angles is the easiest way to draw it my own experience I've found it's easier if I start with the outside atoms and then work my way in so let's start with the chlorine here and work my way in toward the middle so if you look at the chlorine on your periodic table it's in group 17 it has seven valence electrons so every one of these chlorines will get seven electron dots so there's seven for that one seven for this one seven and seven so 28 dots total for those four chlorine atoms next we have carbon so looking at the periodic table carbon is in group 14 so it has four valence electrons so I'm going to put those four dots in there trying to pair these up as well as I can and there's one two three four so I've paired those up and the way I have this drawn it looks like everything has eight and that's the way we want it that's usually the best structure for these molecules for everything to have eight and so I see that in this case I have four shared pairs of electrons there's a shared pair here there's a shared pair here there's a shared pair here and there's a shared pair down there so when I draw the the finished diagram I want to put the lines in there to show that we have four single Bonds in this structure so that's the Lewis electron dot diagram for carbon tetrachloride let's try another one let's try carbon dioxide now once again can you tell me which atom should be the central atom in this I hope you see that it is the carbon since there's only one of those usually the atom that is all by itself is the atom that's in the middle so we'll put carbon in the middle and then we'll have the oxygens on the outside there always start with the outside and work your way in so how many valence electrons does oxygen have well I can look at the periodic table here and see that it's in group 16 so that's six dots for each of those so we'll have six dots on this one and six dots on that one next we have carbon and carbon is in group 14 it has four valence electrons so I'll put the four dots there for carbon and now I need to ask myself does everything have eight well no the oxygens do have eight the way I have it drawn here because it can lay claim to those in the middle and that one there but the carbon only has four so I'm going to have to move some dots around in order for everything to have eight so I'm going to start by moving these dots over here on the outside of oxygen to the middle like this now I'm getting closer aren't I because this oxygen still has eight but now this carbon is up to six now if I do the same thing on the other side by moving maybe this pair into the middle like this now everything has eight doesn't it we this oxygen has eight two four six eight the one on the outs on the right side does as well and the carbon also has two four six eight so everything has the octet now when you draw the structure when you draw that final diagram you'll notice that we have two shared pairs here and two shared pairs there so that's a double bond actually two double bonds so you want to draw it like this to represent the fact that you have double bonds and that's important because usually double bonds are stronger than single bonds and guess what triple bonds are stronger than both of them so this is important whenever we take a look at these structures and we'll talk about the applications of this in an upcoming video let's take a look at ammonia NH3 is the formula for ammonia and can you tell which atom should be the central atom hope you realize it is nitrogen so we're going to put n in the middle and we have the three H's surrounding it I like to start with the outside and work my way in so how many valence electrons does hydrogen have well it's in group one so it only has one valence electrons so I'll put one dot for each of these hydrogen atoms now nitrogen has how many well it's in group 15 so it has five valence electrons so we'll put the five there try to pair those up as much as we can and now the nitrogen has eight don't forget hydrogen is an exception it's stable with just two and each of the hydrogens has two so everything is obeying the octet rule here so we can notice that we have one 2 3 unshared pair uh shared pairs there so we're going to have three single bonds now this unshared pair up here is not bonded to anything it's just hanging out there by itself so we're not going to draw that as a line we just draw those as an unshared pair sometimes called a lone pair right there hanging out on the top of that nitrogen atom well I hope you've learned more about how to draw Lewis electron dot diagrams if you learn something from the video please shoot me a thumbs up and leave a comment down below if you like this and thanks for watching and we're going to continue and look at exceptions to the octet rule even more of them in the next video,"3,755",0,15
"Exceptions to the Octet Rule - AP Chem Unit 2, Topic 5B","In this video, Mr. Krug works through several examples of molecules that are exceptions to the octet rule and exhibit and expanded octet.  He shows students how to recognize a molecule that will be an exception to the octet rule.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4IqrxlrgDw&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=16,we're continuing with unit 2 Section 5 as we look at some exceptions to the octet rule so in this molecule here we're going to draw the Lewis electron dot diagram for Xenon tetrafluoride so once again hopefully you can see that Xenon is going to be the central atom since there's only one of that of that element so we're going to put Xenon in the Middle with the four fluorine atoms around can you see how many valence electrons each fluorine will get well it's in group 17 so I'll put seven dots around each of those so we have seven seven seven and seven and in case you missed the last video you might want to pick that up we always try to start with the outside and work our way in that seems to reduce errors and also try to pair these electrons up as much as you can next we have the Xenon atom how many valence electrons does Xenon have well it has eight as you look at it on the periodic table it's in group 18. so I'm going to put the eight dots around here as well as I can so we have one two three and four and you might see that we kind of have a problem here because we have run out of room we've only put four of xenon's eight dots up here we have to put up five six seven and eight somewhere but where do we do that do we put these as double bonds or something well that's not what we do here's what you do if you run out of room just put the extra electrons as unshared pairs on the central atom so that's something that we'll see quite often whenever there's an expanded octet you run out of room so in this case those last four dots just end up being unshared pairs on the central atom now this is getting a little bit cluttered but what I want you to see is that we have four shared pairs here there's a shared pair here there's a shared pair here as a shared pair here and there's a shared pair here and we have two unshared pairs on that Central atom so this is what your final version of your electron dot diagram should look like where you have four single bonds and then the unshared pairs on that Xenon as well as of course everything on your your fluorines so in this case Xenon has more than eight doesn't it it actually has 12. so you know Xenon will have more than eight some people might take a look at this molecule and say well hang on I thought Xenon was a noble gas and I thought noble gases can't make chemical compounds well that's usually the case but Xenon actually can make several chemical compounds and Xenon tetrafluoride actually does happen to be one of the more common compounds of the noble gases especially Xenon let's take a look at another example we'll try sulfur tetrafluoride so once again you can see that sulfur is our Central atom since there's only one of that element so I'm putting sulfur in the Middle with the four fluorines surrounding it and let's start with the outside work our way in so how many dots will each fluorine get well it has seven right it's in group 17. so seven dots for each of those fluorine atoms and now how about sulfur well sulfur is in group 16 it has six valence electrons we need to put six dots on there so we'll count that out we have one two three four and you see that we have the same problem as we had before we are out of room aren't we we don't have any room to put five and six so where do those go unshared pair on the central atom so I'm going to stick them right there and when we draw our final diagram you want to reflect that we have four single bonds and then there's that unshared pair or that lone pair right there on the sulfur so how many valence electrons does sulfur have in this structure it has 10 doesn't it because we have the eight from those bonds and then we have the unshared pair the lone pair so that makes it a total of 10 valence electrons on the sulfur so that certainly is an expanded octet let's try one more example here let's try phosphorus pentachloride so once again looks like phosphorus is going to be our Central atom and we have five chlorines around it so we'll start with the chlorines and work our way in how many dots does every chlorine get well it's going to be 7 right because chlorine is in group 17 it's a halogen so we'll put the seven dots around each of these seven seven seven and seven trying to pair these up as well as we can I know we have we don't have a whole lot of room here so it gets a little bit cluttered but how about the phosphorus well you look at the periodic table and you see that phosphorus has five dots that it's going to bring to the table here so we're going to put the five dots in there one two three four five and that's going to give everything a bond but do you see a problem here do you see that phosphorus because it has the five bonds there are five shared pairs here one two three four five it has an expanded octet but that's okay anytime you have a central atom like phosphorus in this case that's bonded to more than four atoms that Central atom is going to have to exhibit that expanded octet there's no other way around it so when you draw the final structure this is what it's going to look like the phosphorus that has five single bonds one extending to each of those chlorine atoms so I hope you've enjoyed the video hope you have learned something about expanded octets and how to draw those and work with those as you draw Lewis electron dot diagrams if you learned something please

"Resonance and Formal Charge - AP Chem Unit 2, Topic 6","In this video, Mr. Krug shows how some molecules have multiple resonance structures.  He also shows students how to calculate the formal charge of each atom in a molecule and how to use formal charge to determine which Lewis diagram will represent the most stable structure for a molecule.  00:00  Resonance Structures 05:01  Formal Charge",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th3ZiNN313o&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=17,as we move on to unit 2 Section 6 we're going to be refining our understanding of Lewis electron dot diagrams we're going to do a few more examples here here we have sulfur dioxide and we're going to start with of course sulfur as our Central atom and we have two atoms of oxygen surrounding it there so let's start with the outside and work our way in so each oxygen needs to have six dots brought in for that because oxygen is in group 16 so six dots for this one and six dots for that one and as we look at the table for sulfur it's going to have six dots as well so six dots for the sulfur now we ask ourselves does everything have eight and of course as we look at this the answer is no because the oxygens do seem to have eight if you include the the shared pairs in the middle here but sulfur only has six so we're going to have to move two of these uh dots from the outside into the middle so I'll take a couple dots right from there move them into the middle and now everything has eight as we can see here so I'm going to go ahead and take a look at the fact that we have two shared pairs right here so that's a double bond and we have one shared pair here so that's the single Bond and then we have one unshared pair or one lone pair up here on top of the sulfur so when I draw the final product it's going to look something like this now you might look at that and wonder well what about if we had this question on a test or a quiz or something and instead of drawing this structure you drew a diagram that looked like this now is that okay it's basically just the mirror image isn't it well yes that is okay you could have taken for example one of the unshared pairs from the other side and brought it in to make a double bond and that's perfectly okay in this case we have more than one Lewis electron dot diagram that is correct and accurately reflects the octet rule here now we're going to call these resonance structures resonance structures are when you have two or sometimes more than two Lewis electron dot diagrams with which both represent correct structures for the molecule so if this were on a test either of these would be acceptable let's try another one let's try the nitrate polyatomic ion so this one's a little bit different we'll see how we handle polyatomic ions once again it starts out pretty much like the others the nitrogen is going to be here in the middle so I'll put nitrogen in the center we're going to have the three oxygens surrounding it on the sides and we'll start with the outside so each oxygen needs to have six dots since oxygen is in group 16. so we have six dots here six dots and then we have six dots for that one the nitrogen is in group 15 so five dots from that one so we'll bring in the five dots from that and you might notice that we have an an odd number so how does that work well take a look at the negative sign right there that negative sign tells us that we're going to have to add one bonus electron in here somewhere if it had been a negative two charge you'd have to add in two bonus electrons somewhere but we have one negative charge so do you see a good place where that bonus electron can go and of course that's a good spot for it right there isn't it so that is our structure but of course we see that not everything has eight so you know this nitrogen only has six the way it stands so I'm going to have to move in a pair maybe this pair of electrons from the bottom can go up to the middle and now everything has eight so when I draw my Lewis electron dot diagram I'm going to have a shared pair here for a single Bond a shared paired here for a single Bond and two shared pairs here to make a double bond so it's going to look like this whenever you draw the structure for a polyatomic ion always put its structure in Brackets with the charge out to the side just like I've done here that way anyone who's looking can see that yes we've added in the bonus electron and it's not just we messed up and threw in an electron that wasn't really supposed to be there so we have a resonance structures here as well if you decided to maybe make the double bond over here instead of on the bottom that would be okay or if you put the double bond on the right side that would be okay as well so I can see at least three resonance structures here for this ion actually now let's take a look at another way to refine our Lewis electron dot diagrams this is something called formal charge and the formal charge is a way of assigning a charge to every individual atom in the molecule and if you have a neutral molecule usually the most stable condition that you're going to have is for each atom to have a formal charge of zero now here's how you do this let's take a look at that fluorine atom right there just as an example the way you calculate formal charge is you look at the periodic table and you see how many valence electrons that atom brings into the table so fluorine is in group 17 so it's going to have 7 valence electrons that it brings in so we're going to put 7 there and then we're going to subtract how many it actually has assigned to it in this structure now the way that works is every dot counts as one and every Bond counts as one so one two three four five six and that Bond counts as seven so we subtract that value so 7 minus 7 and the formal charge on the fluorine is zero this is a neutral molecule this is not a an ion or anything so zero is a good thing you want all of these to be zero we can try the one on the bottom and it's basically the same fluorine brings seven valence electrons as it always does and you subtract out one two three four five six seven so seven minus seven is zero that's a good thing the fluorine over here it's the same it brings in seven valence electrons and it has one two three four five six seven assigned to it so seven minus seven is zero that's good you want to have a lot of zeros this is one of those cases where a zero is is a good thing and the nitrogen nitrogen brings in five dots to the table and how many does it have assigned to it one two three four five so it's also zero every Bond counts for one every dot counts for one so everything in this molecule is zero that's a good thing that tells us that this is most likely the actual structure for this molecule the formal charge helps us to confirm that now let's take a look at this structure now we just drew this earlier and we said this this seems pretty good it seems to follow the octet rule let's take a look at the formal charge for everything on here so we'll start with the oxygen right there so how many dots does oxygen bring to the table well it brings in six right it's in group 16. how many does it have a sign to it well let's see one two three four five six seven so six minus 7 is not zero that's a minus one so that atom has a formal charge of negative one let's try the other oxygen okay oxygen always has six valence electrons that it brings in but how many are assigned to it in this structure well there's one two five six because every Bond counts for one so six minus six that one is zero so that's that's good but how about the sulfur in the middle now looking at the table the periodic table sulfur brings in six valence electrons how many dots or how many electrons are assigned to it well we have one two and then three four five so six minus five is positive one so as it turns out even though we thought this was a good structure and you may draw this and it may be fine and acceptable and often the College Board does accept this they don't have any problem with this the fact is it's really not what happens in the real world as it turns out if you look this up in textbooks there's a good chance that you'll find that this structure is more likely to actually exist and that's a little bit strange to us because it actually disobeys the octet rule we kind of have an expanded octet here but it's probably going to be the more stable structure because if you start looking at the formal charge all atoms in that particular structure have a formal charge of zero and so the formal charge is a way to help us refine some of our Lewis electron dot diagrams and make sure that they reflect what we actually see in the real world now let's take a look at a molecule that we've already drawn carbon dioxide and you probably know what the answer is for this already but if you look at these two Lewis electron dot diagrams of carbon dioxide you'll find that both of them actually obey the octet rule technically this one on the left really obeys the octet rule there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this but which of the two structures is more likely to exist well formal charge is what helps us to answer the question because if we start with this oxygen oxygen always brings in six dots but how many dots are assigned to it one two three four five six seven so six minus seven gives us negative one this carbon carbon always brings in four dots and how many dots are assigned to it one two three four so it's zero you know every Bond counts for one and this oxygen here oxygen always brings in six valence electrons but it has one two three four five assigned to it so six minus five is positive one that's not the ideal structure is it zeros are what you want to have across the board for a neutral molecule how about the one that we drew before this is the one that we're more familiar with the oxygen you know it brings in six one two three four five six so that's zero this carbon carbon brings in four dots one two three four assigned to it that's got the zero oxygen starts with six one two three four five six see that one has a formal charge of zero all the way across the board so that's why this is the molecule that's more likely to exist so a good habit to get into is to use formal charge to check your molecules and make sure that you're actually getting the structure that exists in the real world so I hope you've enjoyed this hope you learned something about formal charge and resonance structures as well and I hope to see you in the next video as we move on to unit 2 section 7.,"4,290",0,17
"Sigma & Pi Bonds; Hybridization - AP Chem Unit 2, Topic 7A","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students the characteristics of sigma and pi bonds in a molecule.  He also shows students a simple way to count the number of sigma and pi bonds in a structure.  In the second part of the video, he shows students how to determine the hybridization for any central atom in a molecule.  00:00  Sigma and Pi Bonds 05:06  Hybridization",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xupo4rn2kA&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=18,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we are beginning unit 2 Section 7 which is about how we visualize chemical bonds and visualize these molecules in three dimensions let's Jump Right In here and talk about what chemical bonds can look like so let's imagine that we have a single Bond so imagine we have two carbon atoms like this and there's a single Bond normally what you would see would be that the two electrons are being shared pretty much straight in between those two atoms right there which is probably what you would have expected now let's take a look at a double bond if we have a carbon-carbon a double bond once you notice that this is a little bit different we have two bonds that have to be placed in there somehow and that first bond is going to be shared right in the middle just like it was in the single but your second Bond here is going to be shared in a somewhat different way we have a some this this sort of a looped configuration and so that is what your double bond is for the most part going to look like now what about a triple bond because somehow in a triple bond you have to be able to fit in not one or two but actually three bonds into that little space there well here is how that would work you'd have one of the bonds that's that's in that straight conformation just like we had in the others but now we have a looped Bond going in this direction and then there's a second looped Bond that's actually and this is kind of hard to tell it's actually coming out at us it is in that third dimension and so we have two looped bonds and one straight bond in a triple bond now the straight bonds are given a name those are called Sigma bonds and we represent that with the Greek letter Sigma this little lowercase Sigma that kind of looks like a cursive O and notice that every one of these bonds has exactly one Sigma Bond now the double bond and the triple bond have these looped bonds those are called Pi bonds just like the Greek letter Pi that you use in math so you have that lowercase pi and a double bond has one of these Pi bonds a triple bond has a sigma and two Pi bonds so that's how these bonds are basically configured Sigma bonds just so you know are called that because they're the result of overlapping s orbitals as we've learned previously s orbitals are spherical in shape whereas Pi bonds are the result of overlapping P orbitals and so they have that more of a looped shape uh and so we have Sigma and Pi now some observations about the bonds I tried to draw it in this way but just so that everyone is on the same page about this notice that I drew the single bonds as the longest of the bonds triple bonds are the shortest Bond length double bonds are in the middle if you look at the way I had them configured I tried to draw them like that but make sure that you are aware of that single bonds are the longest triple bonds are the shortest every single bond is a sigma Bond every double bond has one Sigma and one Pi Bond and every triple bond has one Sigma Bond and two Pi bonds now with that information right there you should be able to count up the number of Sigma and Pi Bonds in any molecule that anyone could draw for you now we're going to try a couple examples of this let's take a look at hcn and we're going to figure out how many Sigma bonds and Pi bonds there are here well hopefully you see that there's a single Bond so that's a sigma and then there's a triple bond which is one Sigma and 2 pi so when you add it up it's two Sigma and two Pi bonds so hopefully that's not too difficult what if I were to give you a much more complex molecule something like this maybe some sort of a an organic molecule well it's pretty much the same thing you notice that there are a lot of single Bonds in here in fact every one of those single bonds is going to be a sigma Bond all basically all six of those single Bonds are sigmas there are a couple of double Bonds in here that I see as well and each of those double bonds this one as well as that one will have one Sigma and one Pi so we have those in there and then there's a triple bond in here which is a sigma and 2 pi so when you add up these sigmas and pies hopefully you can see that we have a total of nine Sigma bonds and four Pi bonds so that's how you can count up Sigma bonds and Pi bonds now another very important part of being able to uh to visualize molecules is to understand that there's something called hybridization of orbitals in these molecules now if we think about a fairly simple molecule like a methane one that we've probably drawn a couple times already it has this structure we have the carbon atom in the middle the central atom and then we have four Sigma bonds four single bonds there and we have that molecule but if we start thinking about this we might think that there's something wrong with this structure now what could be wrong with this structure well let's think about the electron configuration of carbon carbon is there in the middle it has four valence electrons that's the electron configuration of carbon and the valence electrons are the only ones that are participating in the bonding so the ones we care about are the 2s2 and the 2p2 electrons so when we plot those on an orbital diagram notation here we have 2s which has the two electrons there and 2p following hunz rule is going to look like this and based upon what I see here I only see two electrons that are looking for a partner it looks like there are only two electrons that are available for bonding and so if carbon can only make two bonds how is it possible that carbon is drawn here making four bonds how is that possible well it makes us Wonder does this molecule exist well it certainly does exist and this is the correct Lewis electron dot diagram so what's going on well the carbon atom in the center there is undergoing something called hybridization its orbitals are hybridized now here's how this works we have these these four orbitals that we're looking at here there's one s orbital and we have three p orbitals and they go through a hybridization process and then we have these four electrons and they're you know each each of those electrons is able to occupy a hybridized orbital so now we have four electrons in four hybridized orbitals now what are these orbitals well they're not fully s and they're not fully P either in fact we can say that they are one part s and three parts P or as we might say s p 3 hybridized and so we would say that the carbon atom in the methane molecule has sp3 hybridization now how can we determine that for any Central atom in a molecule because pretty much any molecule that has a central atom is going to do something like this well here's how you do it it's actually very simple if you've been following along with Sigma bonds and Pi bonds and understanding how these structures work all you have to do is add the number of Sigma bonds on an atom to the number of unshared electron pairs that are touching that atom and when you do that you're going to get a number that's in between 2 and 6. now that number actually has a name that's called the steric number and we sometimes use that to talk about electron geometry as we're going to here in our next video but if that number ends up being 2 then we say the hybridization is sp one part S one part P if the sum ends up being 3 the hybridization is SP2 if the sum is 4 then the hybridization is sp3 if it happens to be 5 then we go up to sp3 D hybridization and if the sum happens to be six we call it sp3 D2 hybridization now we're going to do a few examples with this let's see if we can determine the hybridization of the central atom in each of these molecules so here's hcn we've looked at this molecule a few times already so once again focus on the central atom how many Sigma bonds do we have here well there's one and then there's one over here that's 2. How many unshared pairs on that carbon well I don't see any so 2 plus 0 is 2. so the stearic number is two so what's the hybridization s p s p hybridization that's all you have to do now how about water well how many Sigma bonds are on that Central atom right there well I see two there's one and then there's two so we have two and how many unshared pairs well we have two there's one right there and one right there so two plus two equals four so what's the hybridization if the steric number is four that chart tells us it is sp3 and how about this structure here we have the nitrate polyatomic ion so what's the hybridization of that nitrogen in the middle well how many Sigma bonds one two three because one of those is a pi Bond and doesn't count any unshared pairs on the nitrogen there aren't are there so three plus zero equals three and that's direct number of three gets us a hybridization of SP2 so that's how we do hybridization it's not hard and just so you know on the AP exam if you're taking AP Chemistry they're not going to to use any hybridizations Beyond sp3 on the exam so if you learn something about Sigma and Pi bonds or something about hybridization please shoot me a thumbs up and I hope to see you in the next video where we're going to continue with unit 2 Section 7 learning about molecular geometry and bond angles,"5,207",0,18

unit 2 section 7. in this video we are focusing on the valence shell electron pair repulsion Theory sometimes called the Vesper Theory and we're going to use this to help us understand the molecular geometries and bond angles and shapes basically that these molecules tend to take now when we say valence shell electron pair repulsion theory that means exactly what it says what that means is the only electrons that are participating in the bonding and the structures of these molecules are the valence shell electrons we don't worry about the core electrons here and they are always going to be paired up notice that whenever we draw these structures these Lewis diagrams we always draw the electrons in pairs because that's how they're structured in the molecule they're paired up and they're going to repel each other what that means is that in molecules both the bonding and the non-bonding pairs of electrons are going to repel each other that means that they're going to try to get as far away from each other as they possibly can and as we draw the structures and try to visualize these geometries and actual shapes of these molecules we're going to see that that idea of electron repulsion governs the shapes that these molecules take take so let's take a look at several examples here's the first one this is kind of a basic example if you have a molecule that has a central atom and four Sigma bonds that are emanating from that well notice that this is called a tetrahedral structure now this is shaped quite a bit differently that you than you might have expected it to be shaped based upon the way we draw it on paper when you draw this on paper you might expect to have a 90 degree Bond angle because you have one in the middle and then you always draw them you know in those nice right angles but in the real world molecules are in three dimensions and this is not a 90 degree angle in fact it's significantly more than that this is a 109.5 degree Bond angle and you need to know that you need to know that a tetrahedral Bond angle that is four Sigma bonds a central atom bonded to four other atoms and no no other unshared pairs there will be 109.5 degrees tetrahedral you have to know that I hate to use the m word but yeah you have to memorize that you you do need to know that Bond angles well as well as these other Bond angles as well let's take a look at a case where we have three sigma bonds and one unshared pair now in these pictures I'm going to use one of these little purple uh kind of Slender sticks here to represent the unshared pair in real life unshared pairs of course are electrons and electrons are very very tiny in fact they would for all practical purposes be invisible you would not be able to see that so let's imagine that that electron pair is there but you just can't see it and what you would see is a geometry called trigonal pyramidal because you'd have a base down here that has this triangle as a base so that's why it's trigonal and it's it's raised it has this pyramidal shape to it and its Bond angle is going to be 107 degrees so anytime you have a molecule that has the central atom and three Bond angles and the one unshared pair trigonal pyramidal 107. now maybe you're wondering why is this a smaller Bond angle it fundamentally looks the same as as tetrahedral isn't it and you might even look at this and say it actually does have a a tetrahedral electron geometry right it's electrons are that way but that's not what the molecule looks like in the molecule the bond angle is smaller because unshared electron pairs exert more repulsion than shared pairs so this unshared pair here is able to push those other bonds a little bit closer to each other not much just a couple of degrees worth but enough to make that Bond angle just a tad smaller so that's why this Bond angle in trigonal pyramidal is about 107 degrees now if we were to amputate yet another Sigma Bond off here and turn this into an unshared pair we'd have a molecule with two Sigma bonds and two unshared pairs and it would look something like this and and once again remember that unshared pairs these lone pairs are practically invisible so you would not be able to see these little purple unshared pairs that I have drawn here so what would you have well you'd have what would essentially be a bent structure so you'd see this Central atom and you'd see those two other atoms but you wouldn't see the unshared pair so it is a bent structure and what is the bond angle going to be like here well we know that we have two unshared pairs so guess what the repulsion is going to be a little bit more than it was in the last one so it's going to be down to about you know 104.5 about 105 degrees if you want to round that off to the nearest whole number so about 105 degrees on a bent molecular geometry if you look at the molecules that we've been drawing water is a really good example of this water has the two Sigma bonds it also has two unshared pairs on that Central atom so we see that water has a bent structure it's not linear as some people might think by by looking at it now let's try another structure let's try a structure that has just three sigma bonds doesn't have any unshared pairs on it any lone pairs on there so this is what we have now notice that that is essentially a flat structure it's a flat molecule so in science we call that planar if something is flat it's planar and notice that it essentially has this triangle structure to it this is called trigonal planar and that's exactly what it means it's a flat triangle and the bond angle you can probably figure this out using mathematics a circle is 360 and we've divided this into three equal sectors and so that means Each Bond angle is going to be 120 degrees so anytime you see a molecule with three sigma bonds and if you look back into the notes that we've been looking at in our previous lessons here especially in unit 2 Section 6 and section 5 where we're drawing these structures you can probably point out a few molecules that have this trigonal planar structure 120 degree Bond Angle now what happens if we amputate one of these bonds and replace it with an unshared pair to make it look like this well it's still for all practical purposes planar is still flat but notice that this unshared pair is invisible now and it has a repulsion doesn't so it's going to push those other two bonds a little bit closer to each other and so now we have a structure that we call angular now what's the bond angle here well it's not 120 it's a little bit less than 120. it's about 117 degrees so when you have a structure like this two Sigma bonds with the one unshared pair that has an angular geometry 117 degrees now let's try another structure let's say we have where we have just two Sigma bonds there are no unshared pairs you can probably figure out the bond angle just by looking at it can't you that's 180 degrees and that's called linear and that's a good name for it because it's basically looking like a straight line so it is linear 180 degrees so those shapes are pretty easy to to pinpoint as you're looking through the examples that we've done previously in this unit so these six shapes these are the ones that follow the octet rule these are by far the most common that you're going to encounter in AP Chemistry and to be honest in most of chemistry however you are responsible for knowing some of the other structures the ones that are exceptions to the octet rule more specifically the expanded octets and these have some sometimes a little bit more complicated and somewhat unusual shapes let's try a couple of those let's try a case where you'd have five Sigma and so here I've made the molecular model for that we have a central atom five Sigma bonds and as you look at that you might notice it actually seems to have two different Bond angles there is a trigonal part to this is like a triangle part of this it's kind of lying on its side here and there's also a a pyramidal part of this it's kind of a right angle here as you see at this part here so we actually call this trigonal bipyramidal because it does have that triangular facet to it but also has a pyramid in fact it's two pyramids one up here and then I flip it over there's one down here so the bond angles are 90 degrees and 120 degrees so two Bond angles on this one so a little bit more to learn now what about if we go a little bit higher and say something was Six Sigma Bond something that looks like this we did have a couple of these in our practice I believe something with a Six Sigma bonds well if you look at the structure here this is called octahedral maybe you're wondering why is it called octahedral if it has Six Sigma bonds well if you connect the dots on here you end up with a solid that has eight faces four faces on top flip it over you have four faces on the bottom so we have eight faces kind of looks like a diamond if you were to connect the dots on this and look at the bond angles every single Bond angle is perpendicular it has that 90 degree Bond angle kind of looks like one of those little Jacks that you can spin the kids have that kids used to play with you know another one in fact this will be our last one I believe that I wanted to model for you one that has four Sigma bonds and two unshared pairs and notice the way that I have these configured here I have the two unshared pairs which are going to be for all practical purposes invisible and they are configured as far away from each other as possible all right that's what the Vesper Theory tells us that these unshared pairs will be as far away from each other as possible they want to repel and we have these other Sigma bonds here notice that you're not going to see these unshared pairs so so if you were to look at that and just kind of pretend that those unshared pairs aren't there because they're invisible you're going to have a planar or a flat structure and it looks like a square so Square planar is a good name for this and the bond angle everything has a perfect perpendicular 90 degree Bond angle so those are the nine most common molecular geometries and bond angles now to summarize these are pretty much everything that you see here the ones that we had in the examples plus there are a few more and as you go through here you might see that there are some that might be a little bit different that we didn't have on the examples like Square pyramidal and t-shaped and seesaw and there's another trigonal planar it's good to know those you are expected to know and I once again hate to use the m word but memorize these molecular geometries and bond angles for the AP exam or general chemistry in college you are expected to know these so those are the molecular geometries now how does this affect the way that molecules actually behave in the laboratory and in the real world well there's something called the polarity of a molecule that's very important and as you've looked at these molecules there's a good chance that you've noticed that some of these molecules have somewhat of a lopsidedness to them or maybe an unbalanced region of negative charge these are called polar molecules now in this example that I have with water here you might notice that there's a lopsidedness to it and we see that because right up here on top we have all these lone pairs we have these two lone pairs of electrons just kind of hanging out by themselves and they're unbalanced there's this unbalanced region of negative charge and that's why water is a good example of a polar molecule now what does that mean well it can be attracted by an electric field if you take a balloon just as an example and rub that on your hair just rub the balloon on your hair for a while of course it's going to make your hair stand up now take your take that balloon and place that very close to a narrow stream of water you can try this at home and you'll notice that there's a deflection that balloon is going to attract that stream of water it because and that happens because water is a polar molecule it's attracted to an electric field now how about this is there any unbalanced region of electrons here negative charge that's that's this lopsided unbalanced no everything is perfectly balanced out there are no unshared pairs of electrons here at all this is a nonpolar molecule that means if you could get a little stream of liquid methane for example and you know get that balloon rub that on your hair it would not attract nonpolar how about this molecule this is one that we've seen quite a bit in this unit already is there any unbalanced region of negative charge yeah in addition to the fact that there's a triple bond and this is only single there is this unshared pair right over there on the nitrogen so this is a polar molecule now there are some textbooks and some chemistry teachers that talk about polarity as being or nonpolar molecules as being symmetrical I don't use the word symmetry because it is incorrect it is not correct to say symmetry because you can look at this polar molecule and say it's symmetrical you can draw a line of symmetry down here symmetry has nothing to do with this folks it's not symmetry at all it is lopsidedness it is that's what makes a molecule polar not lack of symmetry that's not what it's about so look for unbalanced electrons look for lopsidedness look for any region where there are electrons that aren't balanced out so let's take a look at a few examples and let's determine if these are polar or nonpolar what about the nitrogen trifluoride well you might notice that we have an unshared pair a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen and it's not balanced out by anything else so that is a polar molecule just a little hint anytime you see exactly one lone pair one unshared pair of electrons on a central atom it's pretty much going to have to be a polar molecule okay so you can just kind of just just remember that one unshared pair on the central atom means it has to be polar and that kind of gives it away on this doesn't it there's one unshared pair on that sulfur that's not balanced out by anything else so yeah this is a polar it has that lopsidedness to it how about carbon dioxide is there any lopsidedness to this any unbalanced region of charge no it's all balanced out we have some unshared pairs over here but they're perfectly balanced out by the unshared pairs over there so that is a nonpolar structure how about phosphorus pentachloride it's all balanced isn't it every there are a bunch of unshared pairs but they're all perfectly arranged around there nothing is lopsided here so this is a nonpolar molecule as well our last example how about ammonia in H3 any lopsidedness here any unbalanced region of charge most definitely there's exactly one unshared pair of electrons on the nitrogen is not balanced out by anything else so this is a polar molecule I hope you've learned something about polarity of molecules and how to determine Bond angles and molecular geometry Vesper Theory there's a lot going on here so keep practicing and this wraps up unit two hope you've enjoyed this hope you've learned a lot about chemistry here go ahead and give me a thumbs up if you learned something I'm looking forward to

"Intermolecular Forces - London dispersion forces - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 1A","In this video, Mr. Krug gives an introduction to intermolecular forces and discusses London dispersion forces.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9YtU828MzM&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=20,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we're jumping right into unit 3 as we talk about the differences between intermolecular forces and intramolecular forces now in this unit we are focusing on the intermolecular forces but we need to know the difference between these two now generally speaking we can say that intermolecular forces are the forces that make molecules stick together and so this is different from intramolecular forces those are the forces inside an individual molecule or within an ionic compound that keeps the molecule or the the compound sticking together so when we talk about intramolecular forces we're specifically talking about covalent and ionic bonding for the most part on the other hand in term molecular forces are going to affect physical properties things like boiling point or a melting point or surface tension or vapor pressure or something like that on the other hand when we talk about intramolecular forces covalent and ionic bonding that's going to affect how reactive or how unreactive the substance is usually intermolecular forces are weaker than covalent and ionic bonds and covalent and ionic bonds of course are going to be much stronger than intermolecular forces so it's important to know the difference between these two types of forces in this unit we're mainly going to be focusing on the intermolecular forces now we're going to focus in this video on a very fundamental type of intermolecular force and these are called London dispersion forces now sometimes they're just called London for forces sometimes they're just called dispersion forces I'm going to go ahead and call them London dispersion forces these are not to be confused with Van Der waals forces that's kind of a label that can include these but it's it is different also so don't get those confused let's imagine though we have an atom of Neon and in that atom we're of course going to have 10 protons in the middle I'm not going to worry about the neutrons because those don't have a charge but we have these these 10 electrons that are for all practical purposes buzzing around in the electron cloud in their energy levels in their sub levels and orbitals and what have you and this is a fairly typical distribution for the electrons of any atom or to be honest any compound as well these electrons are distributed fairly evenly throughout the volume of the atom now we know that electrons are always on the Move they're never sitting still and so it's possible very possible in fact that at some point the electron distribution for neon is going to look more like this and this is just a matter of statistics and probability that at some point these electrons are going to look like that where they're all kind of positioned on one side of the atom or the molecule and when this happens this is called an an instantaneous dipole because we have a temporary lopsided distribution of the electrons here and because of this this is an instantaneous dipole there's there's nothing that's really caused this except for just the the fact the electrons are always moving and these happen to be on one side at this particular moment in time and because of that we have this this structure that temporarily has has a positive pole and so that's why this lowercase Delta is here with the positive that that represents the partial positive charge there and then the Delta negative over here represents the fact that we have all these electrons on this side so that's a partial negative charge there for this atom now this lopsidedness this instantaneous dipole can affect nearby structures let's imagine that we have another atom of neon over here and it's it's minding its own business it's got its its electrons fairly evenly distributed just like the last one had at a certain point but if it's moving and it moves over here guess what's going to happen to the electron distribution well the fact that this atom over here has a positive a partial positive charge is going to attract the electrons to that side of the atom and guess what's going to happen you're going to have something that looks like this and and so now this atom is going to have a partial negative charge and a partial positive charge as well now this this is not just something that happened because of statistics and probability this atom was induced to be like this because of its neighbor we call this an induced dipole and so this is different from the instantaneous dipole that we had on the first atom over there so when you have an instantaneous dipole it can cause kind of a chain reaction because when this atom does this guess what its neighbor is going to do basically the same thing now this is a London dispersion force and all molecules exhibit this because at some point any molecule can have that instantaneous dipole where all its electrons are on one side and or almost all of them anyway and it can cause a chain effect it actually can cause an attraction for those other atoms nearby this happens for all molecules it happens for all atoms it happens for all covalent molecules it happens for ionic compounds every single thing out there every substance exhibits these London dispersion forces however when you encounter a nonpolar molecule that we talked about at the end of unit 2. well guess what non-mole nonpolar molecules only have London dispersion forces and because of that we usually focus on nonpolar molecules when we talk about ldfs London dispersion forces generally speaking the more electrons that a molecule has that means it's more polarizable so more electrons when they're all on one side that's a stronger negative partial charge making the other side stronger in its positive charge and therefore the more electrons you have the stronger the London dispersion forces are going to be and like I said that's the case for all molecules their most prominent in nonpolar molecules but but they exist in all molecules the stronger the molecules intermolecular forces the higher it's boiling point the higher its melting point is going to be you know generally speaking we say that London dispersion forces are the weakest type of intermolecular force however some molecules actually have so many electrons and are so polarizable that their intermolecular forces end up being stronger than some polar molecules now an example of this is a polymer think of plastic plastic basically involves a polymer that's fairly long a fairly large molecule and these are nonpolar so they don't have a pole to them but they have so many electrons because there's such large molecules that they have stronger intermolecular forces than even something like like water and so that's why plastic you have to raise the temperature fairly High to get plastic to melt and some polymers even higher than that so let's take a look at an example now which of these molecules exhibits London dispersion forces now I don't think this is a trick question I just got done saying that all molecules exhibit London dispersion forces so guess what both of these do so don't let something like that trick you all molecules all substances exhibit those ldfs now what if I were to ask which one exhibits stronger London now that's that's something that you can figure out whichever one has more electrons and you can actually look at the periodic table and you can you can add these up but I think most of you can probably eyeball this and see that this butane molecule here is going to have more electrons than the methane molecule and we can confirm this by looking at the boiling points we see that the boiling point of butane is well over 200 degrees Celsius higher than the boiling point of methane because its London dispersion forces are incredibly weak let's do one more exercise here let's rank these nonpolar molecules in order of increasing boiling point how do you do that well think about polarizability the more polarizable it has the higher its boiling point the less polarizable it is the lower its Boiling Point now less polarizable means it has fewer electrons which of these has the fewer electrons well you can look at your periodic table and see that helium will have the fewest so it's got the lowest boiling point which one is next uh you can look at your periodic table see that argon has about 18 electrons this propane molecule has about let's see 18 plus eight about 26 so that means that argon would be next and then propane has the most number of electrons so it has the most polarizability and the highest boiling point and guess what we can look up these boiling points online or in the literature and we can see that our predictions are absolutely correct we can predict relative boiling points of nonpolar molecules by looking at the number of electrons they have I hope you learned something about London dispersion forces here go ahead and give me a thumbs up if you did and I'm looking forward to seeing you in our next section as we continue on to to looking at more types of intermolecular forces in our next video for unit 3 section 1.,"8,408",0,20
"Types of Intermolecular Forces - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 1B","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen bonding, and ionic forces.  He finishes the video by showing students how they can rank boiling points of substances based on types of intermolecular forces.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOoLquXZH3M&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=21,in our last video we focused on London dispersion forces in this video we're going to look at several other types of intermolecular forces and the first one I have for you here will be dipole-dipole forces now in order to explain this let's imagine a molecule of hydrogen chloride just just floating around so here we have HCL and we know from what we've already learned about about the molecular structure that this is going to be a lopsided structure we know that chlorine is very electronegative and hydrogen is not so there is a lopsidedness to this molecule so that means that this electronegative atom is going to have a partial negative charge so that's what that's why there's a Delta negative and then I have a partial positive on the hydrogen side of this so it's Delta positive so we have a polar molecule just like we learned about at the end of unit 2. now if we have several of these molecules next to each other and we have that same lopsidedness as we're going to have well guess what there's going to be an attraction here this positive right here is going to be attracted to the negative side of its neighbor so there's going to be a fairly strong intermolecular force right there and then likewise we have a negative here and it's going to attract the positive side of its neighbor once again a fairly strong intermolecular force this these forces that's called the dipole-dipole force and dipole-dipole forces are only going to be found in polar molecules and so in order to understand this or to to solve these you're going to have to be able to do a Lewis electron dot diagram like we learned at the end of unit 2. so make sure that you can do that so you can determine if something is polar or a nonpolar structure if something is a polar molecule it's going to have dipole-dipole forces but don't forget that it also has London dispersion forces everything has London dispersion forces like I mentioned in the last video now generally speaking uh everything else being equal dipole-dipole forces are going to be stronger than London dispersion forces so if you have similar numbers of electrons that means that if you have a polar molecule it's probably going to have a higher boiling point than a nonpolar molecule and of course there's a caveat there similar numbers of electrons if you have something with a a whole lot larger number of electrons in a nonpolar molecule well its ldfs might be be stronger but you know everything else being equal dipole-dipole tends to be a little stronger than London dispersion so which of these molecules has the higher boiling point can you look at this and figure it out well we hopefully know that this butane molecule is a nonpolar structure you know most of these organic hydrocarbons are just nonpolar if it's just C and H so that's just London dispersion forces but if you draw out nitrogen trichloride you'll see that this is a polar molecule so it has ldfs but also dipole-dipole forces so we're going to say that this has the higher boiling point and of course this is confirmed by looking it up online in the chemical literature we find that the boiling point is a whole lot higher than it is for butane and by the way sometimes when we say dipole-dipole forces it's given a boiling point forces it's given a slightly different name sometimes they say that if something has a dipole-dipole force it has a dipole moment and that's spelled just like it sounds it's having or it has a dipole moment which sounds kind of strange but that's just the same thing it means it's got dipole dipole forces or it is a polar molecule now let's go on to another very important molecule and that's water this is a molecule that we've looked at many times in this course already even though we're just in unit 3 and we have water and we know that oxygen is very electronegative and this is very lopsided this is a bent structure so this is going to be a very polar molecule so we can draw the partial negative right here next to the oxygen and the partial positive next to the the hydrogen end of that molecule and if we have another water molecule and of course probably lots and lots of water molecules around I bet you can see what's happening here we have a very strong force between the negative side of this molecule and the positive side of its neighbor so there's a very strong intermolecular force in between those two molecules and for all practical purposes that's a dipole-dipole force isn't it that's what we just talked about however there's something special about this molecule about water and molecules that are a lot like it the fact is hydrogen is an extremely tiny atom in fact it is basically the tiniest atom that you could ever have in a molecule it's as small as it gets as far as atoms that are in molecules and because hydrogen is so small it means that in a neighbor in a neighboring water molecule the oxygen can get extremely close to that molecule and you know what oxygen is not only very electronegative it's also a fairly tiny atom it is one of the tiniest atoms not as small as hydrogen but it is very tiny which allows other water molecules to get to it to scoot up very close to it and because of that small distance between the molecules that means that hydrogen bonding is very strong that's why this is given a special name this is basically Coulomb's law this the closer the distance between the molecules the stronger the intermolecular attraction and that's what we have here basically an application of Coulomb's law this intermolecular force is very strong this is a whole lot stronger than just your everyday run-of-the-mill dipole-dipole Force in a hydrogen bond it it's a dipole-dipole force but it's it's a very strong form of this and it's only going to be found in molecules that contain an oxygen hydrogen bond like you have in water or a nitrogen hydrogen bond or a fluorine hydrogen bond so if you see one of those combinations that's the tip off that you're going to have a hydrogen bond in that molecule very very strong force generally these are a whole lot stronger than London dispersion forces or just your everyday run-of-the-mill dipole-dipole force and this also helps us to explain why if you have a polar molecule that has fluorine oxygen or nitrogen in it it's probably going to dissolve in water because molecules like this can hydrogen bond with water itself now if we look at this example hopefully we could look at that and determine which of those molecules will have hydrogen bonding it's the one that's going to have one of those three Bonds in it and that would be NH3 because it has a nitrogen hydrogen bond the no bond No that's not going to work because of course you have to have hydrogen in order to have a molecule with hydrogen bonding so let's take a look at this question let's say that a chemistry student observes that ammonia and H3 readily dissolves in water while ph3 gas does not explain this phenomenon in terms of intermolecular forces well it has to do with the fact that we have a molecule here that can hydrogen bond with water ammonia and that happens because it's nitrogen atom there in the center is both very small and also very electronegative whereas the ph3 molecule only has fairly weak attractions to water it's not able to hydrogen bond to water because the phosphorus atom is is somewhat larger and it's not nearly as electronegative as nitrogen is and so hydrogen bonding can also help us to explain why some substances dissolve in water and others do not now let's use what we've learned in this video and the last one to rank these compounds in order of increasing boiling point now we know that London dispersion forces alone will be the weakests so that would have the lowest boiling point so the one that's nonpolar is carbon dioxide so you're nonpolar is the lowest and then what's next well London dispersion forces is lower and then you'll have dipole-dipole so which one is just a normal run-of-the-mill dipole dipole well that would be nitrogen dioxide it is a polar molecule and so that's that's in the middle and then hydrogen bonding is the highest of the three that we've learned so far and that would have to be water because water has hydrogen bonding and so there's your your ranking and if we once again look up the boiling points online or in the chemical literature we can see that our predictions are absolutely correct the one with just London dispersion forces very low the one that's got dipole-dipole forces kind of in the middle hydrogen bonding will be the highest now there is another force that we need to be aware of and we're talking about ionic forces now we've talked about ionic forces already back in uh back in in unit two but it's worth remembering that ionic forces are very strong so in this description or this picture of magnesium oxide this cartoon here we can see that these electrostatic forces you know the positives and the negatives that's very strong in fact that's stronger than ldf that's stronger than dipole-dipole it's even stronger than hydrogen bonding so that's why we say ionic forces are the strongest of these four and so ionic compounds are going to have the highest melting point the highest boiling point of pretty much any of these other compounds except for a certain exception that we'll talk about here in an upcoming video so to review like I said ionic forces are the strongest and if you're asked to to rank those use the same strategies that we learned back in unit two uh think about the charge you know a plus two minus two is going to have a stronger attraction than a plus one minus one if it's a tie then think about ionic size larger ions are more weakly attracted to each other than smaller ions hydrogen bonds are the second strongest and then it goes dipole-dipole after that and then London dispersion forces are the weakest generally speaking and of course if it's a tiebreaker like we saw earlier the one that's got more electrons is more polarizable and will have the stronger London dispersion forces so let's try an example here for each of the following compounds let's state which type of intermolecular forces you would have now just by default I hope you always say London aspersion forces because everything has London dispersion forces but this also has hydrogen as well as oxygen and that nitrogen in there so it's pretty safe to say we're going to have hydrogen bonding as well so that's that's true what about barium sulfate by default you want to say London dispersion force right but does it have anything else metal non-metal right cation anion so it's all it also has ionic forces so London aspersion forces and ionic forces what about methane well that's a nonpolar molecule after we drew that so many times in the unit two right so this is just London dispersion forces nothing else because it is a how about nitrogen trifluoride once again by default it always has London dispersion forces but if you draw it out you notice that it's going to have a polar structure it has an unshared electron pair on top a lone pair so it's going to have dipole-dipole forces as well so you can basically take a look at any structure and answer this question answer which type of intermolecular the forces are present now we're going to look at these same four structures these same four molecules and now we're going to rank them in order of increasing boiling point so which one is the lowest which one is the lowest on that hierarchy well it's the one that's just London dispersion forces so that's going to be the methane what's a little bit higher dipole dipole all right so that's your nitrogen trifluoride that should be hydrogen bonding right so that's our hno3 and what's the highest of them all that would be ionic forces so barium sulfate and once again you can look these up and confirm that that's that that's the case I hope you learned something about intermolecular forces how to rank them how to determine the intermolecular forces that are present in substances if you learn something please smash that thumbs up button and leave a comment down below it really does help the algorithm I hope to see you on my channel in the next video which is going to cover unit 3 section 2.,"5,767",0,21
"Properties of Solids - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 2","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses the properties of solids, including ionic solids, molecular solids, and covalent network solids.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_14asNzvc0&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=22,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we are moving on to unit 3 section 2 which is about how intermolecular forces affect the physical properties of liquids and and solids so we're going to start by talking about vapor pressure now if you can imagine a bottle of water or some other liquid and it's enclosed so we have a cap some sort of a lid on top of this water bottle or this bottle containing liquid well we know that that liquid is going to evaporate to some extent not all of it but some of it will and while that vapor is inside the closed bottle or closed container that vapor is going to push back down on the liquid and that pressure is called vapor pressure the pressure exerted by a vapor back down on the liquid from which it evaporated and different liquids have either higher or lower Vapor pressures generally speed taking as you raise the temperature of a liquid the vapor pressure of a liquid is going to increase I think intuitively that makes sense we know that when you raise the temperature you're going to evaporate more of the liquid and so if you have an enclosed container you'll have more Vapor trapped inside the bottle or the container and it'll create of course more pressure as it pushes back down on the liquid now another factor that we have to think about will be intermolecular forces liquids that have very weak intermolecular forces are going to evaporate much more easily and much more readily so since they evaporate more easily you have more vapor in the container and you'll have a higher vapor pressure so weaker intermolecular forces correlate to higher Vapor pressures and you can also go the other direction the stronger the intermolecular forces the better the molecules stick together the lower the vapor pressure is going to be now this also has to do with the boiling point when you have weaker intermolecular forces you have a lower boiling point that means it's going to be a whole lot easier to force those molecules in the liquid phase apart and they're going to fly off into the gaseous phase very easily we'll take a look at a graph of this here and here on this on this graph I have four different liquids and their Vapor pressures as a function of temperature so on the x-axis we have temperature in degrees Celsius and on the y-axis we have vapor pressure in kilopascals we have a dotted line that represents 101.3 kilopascals because that is normal atmospheric pressure at sea level so that's about one atmosphere so as we look at the graph we should be able to answer a few questions about it so for example can we estimate the vapor pressure of ethanoic acid at 120 degrees Celsius now this question is just a matter of reading the graph so we'd find 120 degrees Celsius which is right around here and we slide up to the curve for ethanoic acid and hopefully you can see that the answer should be something fairly close to about 110 kilopascals maybe a touch less than that but very close to 110 kilopascals how about this question at what pressure in kilopascals would water boil at 90 degrees Celsius well it's just a matter once again of reading the graph we find the 90 degree celsius line which is right around right around here it looks like and we slide up to the graph or to the curve for water which is right here and we go over to the y-axis and it looks like it's very close to 70 kilopascals now this shows us that you can change the the boiling point of water or pretty much any liquid just by changing the pressure so if you're at a higher elevation where you have less pressure less air pushing down on you water is going to boil at a lower temperature and likewise if you increase the pressure water is going to boil at a higher temperature which is what the graph shows as well that's how pressure a cooker Works actually now based upon this graph we should also be able to answer this question which of these liquids has the weakest intermolecular forces now think back to what we said a couple of slides ago we said that weaker intermolecular forces will correlate to higher vapor pressure so all we have to do is find pretty much any temperature which of these liquids has the highest vapor pressure at pretty much any temperature I mean just take a random temperature like maybe right here 35 degrees and you see that by far the answer is propanone so propanone is the answer it has the weakest intermolecular forces and as it turns out that also will have the lowest boiling point as well which which makes sense along with that question now let's shift phases and talk about solids specifically ionic solids now ionic solids are composed of ionic compounds which of course is no surprise as we talked about in unit 2 they are in a crystal lattice and so this is a picture that we've looked at before this might be a typical ionic compound let's say it's sodium chloride in which the sodium ions are these little represented by the purple circles or spheres and the chloride ions are the larger ones those little green or the somewhat larger green spheres that's how these ionic compounds are ordered this nice orderly arrangement this lattice now you probably know from your own experience that ionic compounds like salt are brittle and can be easily shattered and that has a lot to do with the way this Crystal is structured if you take a hammer and you hit it you know as long as this this Cube this this lattice is intact and it's not Disturbed it's fairly strong and it's strong because you have these electrostatic attractions you have the positives and the negatives that are that are attracting each other very strongly the positives and those negatives that's a very strong force to be honest what happens if you tap this with a hammer though well if you get this this lattice uh kind of off-kilter by just even one row and you get it to the point where maybe one of these green spheres is right next to a green and a purple is right next to a purple all of a sudden you have like charges next to each other and they repel and so literally it just forces itself apart and so just even a little tap with a hammer that gets this this lattice just off kilter by even one row it's just it just shatters very easily so that's how that works it has a lot to do with the charges in there now as you probably know as well in the case of salt and lots of others ionic solids will conduct electricity when they're dissolved in water or when they're melted as well so very easily conducting and that's because you have all these charges positives and negatives swimming around in the water and those charged particles allow the electrons to pass through very easily now another type of solid that you need to know about are molecular solids and these are solids composed of not ionic compounds but covalently bonded compounds and here we have the case of water we have these little water molecules as you can see and they're attaching to each other and so if this is a solid and it's water then what we're seeing here is ice now the forces that hold molecules together in a molecular solid aren't nearly as strong as they are in an ionic solid so what happens is these molecular solids are going to have fairly low boiling points and low melting points in the case of solids we should say so there are lots of examples of these molecular solids things like ice as we see here moth balls which we call naphthalene a lot of the polymers like this fairly easy to get these these uh these molecules to disassociate themselves from each other so we have ionic solids we have the molecular solids and there's another kind of solid as well covalent Network solids this is kind of a special type of bonding because there are some elements some covalent compounds that have a repeating network of covalent bonds and because of the of the repeating Network that's there you have a very strong structure very difficult to break in fact it is so strong it's actually as far as I can think of one of the very few types of bonds that's stronger than your run-of-the-mill ionic compound you might remember in the last section we said that ionic compounds have a really high melting point right well the only thing that I can think of that we're talking about in this class anyway that's higher than that would be covalent Network solids things like diamond and graphite silicon dioxide that's sand basically silicon carbide and so in the case of diamond we know that that's the hardest material known to humanity today that's naturally occurring anyway and if we have a submicroscopic model of what's going on there you'll notice that every carbon atom in diamond is attached to if I'm counting correctly four other molecules maybe more than that I don't know but they're they are connected in multiple dimensions multiple directions and so that makes this lattice or this this a network we should call it so strong it's almost impossible to break that Bond and so that's why diamond is such a a hard material silicon dioxide sand or quartz it's also very very hard and that's because of those covalent Network bonds it's you have a network that's connected in so many different dimensions and directions it's almost impossible to break try to take sand and burn sand can you burn it I mean no in fact sand is often used to put out fires if that's the case why is graphite used in pencils maybe how we're thinking you know graphite covalent Network solids why do we use graphite DNA just a regular pencil and we can write with graphite well if you look at the bonding for graphite what you have are these sheets here and so you have a sheet of carbon and in in between that sheet itself those bonds are extremely strong it's almost impossible to burn graphite you have to get the temperature up to thousands of degrees to burn graphite but the bonding in Between the Sheets from one sheet to another is actually extremely weak and so that's why you can take a pencil that has graphite in it and write on a piece of paper and those little individual sheets of graphite literally flake off onto the piece of paper but these are the substances that have covalent Network solids on the AP Chemistry exam you aren't going to be asked about too many of these generally Diamond graphite silicon dioxide and silicon carbide are usually the four that they will limit it to now let's apply this knowledge let's use what we know about chemical bonds to explain why carbon dioxide has such a low boiling point while silicon dioxide has such a high boiling point and if you look at the periodic table you might think you know Carbon and silicon are you know one is right above the other on the periodic table you would expect them to be pretty similar chemically but as it turns out they are very different what has to do with the fact that carbon dioxide is composed of individual molecules containing covalent bonds and so those forces that are keeping them together are relatively weak they're basically just uh London dispersion forces but silicon dioxide has covalent bonds but we're talking about a covalent Network solid and so the repeating lattice of bonds in those multiple directions will give silicon dioxide extra strength and that's why it has an extremely hot boiling point so this brings us to the end of section 3.2 hope you learned something about solids and liquids and how they are associated with each other if you learn something please give me a thumbs up and I hope to see you in my next video in which we're going to continue on to section 3.3 right there in unit 3. thanks for watching,"5,449",0,22
"Solids, Liquids, & Gases - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 3","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses the properties of solids, liquids, and gases as well as the key differences among them.  He also shows what makes some materials amorphous.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G88-AcHVbA&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=23,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and you are watching my complete AP Chemistry course as we're moving on to unit 3 section three and as we see these two pictures here I have a question for you for most of you is probably a fairly simple question which one of these is a solid and if you answered the one on the left over here you would be correct and maybe you answered that for different reasons maybe you saw that the atoms or the particles are very very close to each other in that picture so that is a tip off that that's the solid and we also know that we have this nice orderly crystalline pattern that's a good sign of a solid as well whereas we just don't have that in the picture here on the right you know true solids are crystalline in structure so we've talked about ionic solids other solids uh covalent Network solids how they have this nice crystalline structure even most of these molecular solids have that crystal structure think of ice right think of snowflakes beautiful crystals we call this a crystal lattice a very orderly structure where it repeats it itself now there are some solids that aren't exactly crystalline but they have other properties of solids for example if we want to think of a piece of plastic or possibly other materials that you know are kind of like Assad but they're not really a solid like for example I think Plastics are a good example a piece of paper that's another one it seems to be somewhat solid it's not flowing or anything like that but it's certainly it certainly has some properties of solids it may have a structure kind of like this where it's not really crystalline but the molecules pretty much have a place these are called amorphous materials true crystalline solids but we can we can call them a type of solid amorphous materials can be considered a type of solid they're almost in that gray area between solid and liquid they have some some properties of liquids but they're they're more solid these materials are best described as amorphous and so that would include things like Plastics things like uh you know like I said a piece of paper uh perhaps some people would even describe glass as being somewhat amorphous as well now let's take a look at another couple of pictures here which one here is a gas and if you answered the picture on the right you would be correct and why is that a gas well a couple reasons you can see that the molecules are spaced much farther apart in a gas aren't they whereas over here the molecules are squished pretty close to each other so this is probably a liquid in the picture on the left also we have these little streaks behind each molecule which implies that they're moving fairly quickly and as we know gas molecules will most likely be moving faster than molecules of a liquid higher temperature you know when we say gas or gas molecules gas molecules tend to be very far apart from each other in a solid the molecules are very close to each other they're just vibrating against each other they are in this nice crystalline pattern most of the time in a liquid the molecules are a little bit farther apart and they have just enough space between them so that they can slip and slide past one another that's why a liquid can flow on the other hand gas molecules are very far apart from each other in fact they're so far apart from each other that they hardly have anything to do with each other at all they're pretty much independent of each other and because gas molecules are so far apart we're actually able to physically squeeze some of the molecules closer to each other and we can compress a gas you may have tried this before if you have taken like a a medicine dropper and you've stuck your finger over the the the end of it you can push it down push the air down there and actually compress the gas in fact a gas is the only one of our three main states of matter solid liquid and gas that can be compressed very much and also can expand to fill a container you can't do that with a solid or a liquid now all gases have four properties that you need to be aware of and these are the four properties that we're going to be manipulating as we go into our next section in unit 3 section 4 to talk about gas laws the first pre the first property is pressure and you probably have an understanding of what pressure is pressure is determined by how often the gas molecules are colliding with the walls of the container that's basically what determines pressure so if you're able to somehow maybe compress down the the volume or maybe make the the molecules move faster by heating it up well those molecules hit the container walls more often and that increases the pressure so that's what pressure is and of course there are several units for pressure like atmospheres kilopascals such as like that we have others as well volume volume is a property of all gases it's the amount of space that the gas takes up we usually measure volume in liters in the SI framework they often use cubic meters but a cubic meter is such a large volume we usually keep it in liters in in AP Chemistry and general chemistry now temperature this is another important property of all gases it's a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules whenever you see the phrase average kinetic energy right there that is a fancy phrase that is interchangeable with temperature that is what that means average kinetic energy is the same thing as temperature and kinetic energy involves two factors the mass and the velocity in physics we know that kinetic energy is mass times velocity squared divided by two you don't really have to do that much with kinetic energy in AP Chemistry you just have to know its mass and velocity if you take a golf ball and drop it on your foot it's probably not going to hurt you if you take a bowling ball and drop it on your foot it probably is going to hurt you because it has a greater mass so more energy being transferred to your foot on the other hand velocity if you take a golf ball and you just drop it on your foot it's not going to hurt but if you take a golf ball and shoot it out of a of a some sort of a propeller at I don't know 100 meters per second that's really going to hurt because the velocity is higher so it's transferring more energy to your foot so those are the two factors that go into kinetic energy temperature the molecules are moving faster at a higher temperature now the fourth property of all gases would be just how much gas you have how many gas molecules there are and as we've stated earlier in this course back in unit one we normally don't measure this in actual number of of molecules because it would it's kind of a ridiculous to count molecules we count them in moles and so we'll talk about you know half a mole one mole 0.75 moles and that's how we talk about how much gas we actually have so in the next lesson or the next section we're going to see how we can manipulate these four properties pressure volume temperature and the amount of gas to to change the other properties as well hope you learned something here about the properties of of solids and gases as well in this section if you learn something please give me a thumbs up and hope to see you in my next video in which we're going to get started with gas laws in unit 3 section four thanks for watching,"3,907",0,23
"Boyle's Law, Charles' Law, Gay-Lussac's Law - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 4A","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to solve problems using four fundamental gas laws:  Boyle's Law, Charles' Law, Gay-Lussac's Law, and the Combined Gas Law.  He works several problems throughout the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZxN6Zfzipc&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=24,hi there I'm Jeremy krogg and welcome back to my AP Chemistry complete course here on YouTube we are jumping right into unit 3 section four which is labeled the ideal gas law but we need to realize that there are some other gas laws that are a part of this as well that help us to understand the ideal gas law one of those is the Boyle's Law now this is one of the very first laws in chemistry that were formulated at all several hundred years ago to be honest and this law says that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume now I have inversely proportional in bold here because it's important to know what that means when one of your factors goes up the other Factor goes down so what that means is as the volume goes down the pressure goes up inside the container and the converse is true as well when the volume goes up the pressure goes down and this is Boyle's Law now mathematically we can use this equation P1 V1 equals p2v2 to to solve a problem using Boyle's Law now when we look at this graphically if you were to take the pressure and the volume of a substance and start changing it and you could plot it on a graph this is what it would look like this is what the pressure versus volume graph would look like now let's do an example problem with Boyle's Law a balloon is filled with 30 liters of helium gas at one atmosphere what is the volume when the balloon Rises to an altitude where the pressure is only 0.25 atmospheres now as you can see we're going to use Boyle's Law and we're just going to basically plug and chug right into this equation so P1 represents the starting pressure and so that's one atmosphere we're going to plug that in there and V1 represents the starting volume which is 30 liters we plug that in and P2 is going to be the ending or the final pressure and it says that pressure at the end is only 0.25 atmospheres so I'll plug that in and V2 is the final volume and that's what we're trying to solve for the question asks what is the volume so we're going to solve for that and it would be wise to have your calculator out during this video so that you can solve the answers along with me and if you do that or I don't know maybe you can solve this in your head and you can see that V2 equals about 120 liters and so that's the answer to this problem we just plug it in using Boyle's Law now another gas law that is an important part of the ideal gas law is Charles law and Charles law tells us that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature now notice I have the phrase directly proportional in bold again what that means is if one of the factors goes up the other factors goes up as well if one of the factors goes down the other Factor goes down too so what this is telling us is if you heat up an enclosed gas the volume is going to expand if you cool down an enclosed gas its volume is going to contract for a lot of us that does seem like common sense now here is the equation that goes along with that V1 over T1 equals V2 over T2 now there is a little bit of a catch here this only works if we're talking about temperature in Kelvins and so we have to make sure our temperature is in kelvins and if you've forgotten how to convert Celsius to kelvins there's the there's the equation now the AP exam will give you that equation but I would I would hope that most high school students would be able to solve that even if they didn't give you that equation okay so that is very important to be able to do now when we have a graphical representation of this this is what that would look like as you increase the temperature volume goes up as well so this is a fairly linear relationship if you look at this on a graph let's try a problem with Charles law a balloon in an air-conditioned room at 27 degrees Celsius is inflated to a volume of 4.0 liters it is then heated to a temperature of 57 degrees Celsius what is the new volume of the balloon if the pressure remains constant well if you look at the question you can see it's talking about temperature changing that's T and the volume is changing from 4 liters to some new volume so temperature and volume that sure sounds like Boyle's Law so we're going to plug and chug into that equation now V1 the starting volume it says is 4.0 liters we're going to plug that in and then T1 down here on the bottom is 27 degrees Celsius now we're not going to write 27 though do you remember what we have to do to that temperature we have to convert it to Kelvin so if you add 273 to that you're going to get about 300 Kelvins now on the other side of the equal sign V2 well the question says what is the new volume so that's what we're going to be solving for and T2 our new temperature is 57 degrees Celsius now we have to convert that to so add 273 to that and you should get an answer of about 330. so with this equation do you have a a strategy for solving this personally I would cross multiply so they cross multiply in this direction I get 300 times V2 and in the other direction that's equal to 1 320. I divide both sides by 300 and I find that the final volume is about 4.4 liters and that makes sense because the temperature went up so the volume should go up as well since they're directly proportional so that's Charles law a third gas law that is an integral part of the ideal gas law would be called galusax law and this law says that the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature now there's that phrase directly proportional again so that means that if the temperature goes up the pressure goes up if the temperature goes down the pressure goes down as well and this helps us to explain why if you've seen an empty can of spray paint or hairspray or something like that on the side of the can it's going to say do not throw into fire because you have an enclosed gas in there and you if you throw it into the fire the temperature shoots up really high and guess what that means the pressure shoots up very high and the nozzle might not be able to handle that and the whole thing just blows up uh of course don't try that at home so pressure and temperature are directly proportional here's the equation for that P1 over T1 equals P2 over T2 and just like it was before temperature has to be in kelvin so make sure that you convert any Celsius temperature you have over to kelvins so let's take a look at this graphically it looks a lot like the Charles law graph as you increase the temperature you increase the pressure so this is a fairly linear relationship now let's take a look at a problem a tire has a pressure of 20.0 PSI when the temperature is negative 17 degrees Celsius what will be the tire pressure when the temperature goes up to 30 degrees Celsius so once again we're talking about pressure changing because we go from 20 psi to some new pressure and we have temperature changing as well from negative 17 degrees to 30 degrees so we're going to use Galax law and we're going to plug and chug so P1 is our starting pressure and it looks like that's going to be the 20.0 PSI so I'm going to plug that in and then we have T1 in the denominator which is negative 17 degrees Celsius now remember we have to convert that to kelvins so when we add 273 that gets us an answer of about 256 Kelvins on the other side of the equal sign we have our final pressure our P2 and that's what we're trying to solve for it says what will be the tire pressure so we're going to leave that as our unknown our final temperature our T2 well that's 30 degrees Celsius when you convert that to kelvins what is that it's around 303 kelvins isn't it so we have that now we can cross multiply and solve for P2 so in this direction I have 256 times P2 equals in this other direction 6060 if I divide both sides by 256 I get an answer of about 23.7 PSI so that's our answer and that makes sense because if you raise the temperature you'd expect the pressure to go up as well the hard part of solving some of these gas law problems is knowing which equation to use we've looked at three gas laws already and when you have a problem it's not going to come right out and say use Boyle's Law or use a galusex law you're going to have to figure out which gas law to use so let's try this example let's say we have a sealed zippered plastic bag that has 1.00 liter of air sealed inside at a room temperature of 21 degrees Celsius when the bag is placed into a freezer at a temperature of negative 18 degrees Celsius what will its volume be so we have to decide which gas law to use do you see which one it is of R3 we're talking about temperature changing and the volume is changing too because it goes from one liter to some new volume that it asks us about so volume and temperature which gas lies T and v v and T that's Charles law isn't it so we're going to plug into Charles law so V1 is your starting volume which is 1.00 liter and then your T1 is your starting temperature so 21 degrees Celsius is going to end up being you know convert that to kelvins it's going to be 294 Kelvins and then V2 is our final volume we're solving for that well let's volume B and then T2 is our final our final temperature so convert the negative 18 degrees Celsius to kelvins you don't add 273 and you get 255 kelvins so now all you have to do is cross multiply and solve for v2 so when you cross multiply we get something like this divide by 294 and hopefully your answer is well is going to be that the final volume is about 0.867 liters that makes sense because if we cool down the temperature we would expect the volume in the bag to contract so that's exactly what happened here now we have these three gas laws we're going to take all three of these Boyle's Law and Charles law and galusex law we're going to put them all together and put them into something called the combined gas law which literally is those three gas laws all put together and it looks like this and hopefully in the combined gas law you can see all three of those other gas laws we just talked about kind of hidden in there they're all put together we have we have them all in there P1 V1 over T1 equals P2 V2 over T2 and this is the gas law that you'll use if pressure volume and temperature are all changing at the same time so let's try an example with this gas law it says a container with an initial volume of 1.0 liter is occupied by a gas at a pressure of 1.5 atmospheres at 25 degrees Celsius by changing the volume the pressure of the gas increases to 6.0 atmospheres as the temperature is raised to 100 degrees Celsius what is the new volume so as you read the problem you can see that it's a fairly a busy problem isn't there lots of numbers in there but we can keep this straight all we have to do is plug and chug into the combined gas law so we'll just start at the beginning P1 that's the starting pressure so that's right there 1.5 atmosphere so that gets plugged in in the P1 position how about V1 V1 is our starting volume what is the starting volume well it says right there our initial volume is 1.0 liters so plug that in there now on the denominator we have to plug in T1 our starting temperature so what is that it's 25 degrees Celsius got to convert that to kelvins so you know add 273 and you get that that's 298 kelvins in the denominator there for T1 now on the right side P2 the final pressure what is the final pressure well it says the pressure increases to 6.0 atmosphere so that's our P2 right there and then V2 is in our next position do we know what that is we don't it says what is the new volume so we're going to solve for for v2 now what goes in the denominator well that's our T2 our final temperature it says the temperature is raised to 100 so convert that to kelvins that becomes 373 Kelvins so we have successfully mined all the data out of the problem and we've plugged it into the equation now we just have to do the math so on your calculator you can key this in 298 times 6.0 times V2 gets this 1788 times V2 and then in this other direction 1.5 times 1.0 times 373 gets us about 559.5 when you divide by 1788 and isolate your answer you get that V2 equals about 0.313 liters so wow that's a lot of work but that's what you have to do to solve these problems using the combined gas law you have to mine the numbers out of the problem and then do the math and solve for the answer well we have laid the groundwork for jumping into the ideal gas law in our next video These are some very important fundamental gas laws that any general chemistry students should be able to do so I hope you've enjoyed the video hope you learned something from it this was a little bit longer than some of the other videos If you learned something please hit that thumbs up button and leave a comment down there below thanks for watching I'm

"Ideal Gas Law PV=nRT - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 4B","In this video, Mr. Krug shows how to use the Ideal Gas Law, PV=nRT, to solve various types of gas problems, including those that ask students to determine molecular mass of a gas and gas density.  He works several problems throughout the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77xhRWWpIi4&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=25,welcome back to AP Chemistry I'm Jeremy Krug and we are still in unit 3 section 4 and we're focusing on the ideal gas law in this video so the ideal gas law is written as PV equals nrt so what do all of these these variables and letters stand for well p stands for pressure and specifically in this gas law pressure needs to be in atmospheres and so that means if for some reason you get a pressure that's not in atmospheres you're going to have to convert it to atmospheres now V represents the volume of the gas and that's going to need to be in liters once again if for some reason you're given a volume that's not in liters if it's in milliliters or gallons or something like that cubic meters you're going to have to convert it to liters in order to use it in the ideal gas law now n stands for the number of moles of gas and so when you look at the moles of gas you know if you give a if you're given a value that's not in moles like grams or possibly molecules of gas moles before you can plug it into n into this equation now T stands for the temperature of the gas and that needs to be in kelvins and just like it was in the the gas laws in the previous video if for some reason the temperature is not given in kelvins if it's in Celsius or something else you have to convert it to kelvins in order to make this work now if you look at these these four variables here you'll notice that these correspond perfectly to the four properties of gases that we talked about a couple of videos ago we said that every gas has a pressure it has a volume it has a temperature and it has a quantity of gas in this case it's moles so we have those four quantities well what's the relationship among those four variables well that's where the r comes in the r is the variable that makes all of this equal out and r represents the universal gas constant and that value is equal to 0.0821 liter atmospheres per mole Kelvin now depending on the textbook depending upon you whom you ask they may Express this like this they may write it as 0.08206 if you want to go out to four significant figures but this is essentially the value for R now notice the units it's a constant so it has funny units liter atmospheres per mole Kelvin and that's one of the reasons why you have to have all these other units in those prescribed units if you don't then your consonant doesn't work so you have to use those those other units kelvins moles liters and atmospheres in order for this constant to work so 0.0821 we're going to do a few examples together here in the video to see how we understand the ideal gas law so we have a rigid steel container with a volume of 20.0 liters and it is to nitrogen or filled with nitrogen gas to a final pressure of 200 atmospheres at 27 degrees Celsius how many moles of nitrogen gas does the cylinder contain so we're going to use PV equals nrt and we're going to plug and chug now P is for pressure excuse me for pressure so notice that unlike the gas laws we had in the last video we're not changing anything there's no initial pressure and final pressure it's just pressure so it tells us right here that the pressure is 200 atmosphere so we're going to plug that in for p now V is the volume same thing there's not an initial and a final it's just a volume and it's given right to us here in the problem the volume is 20.0 liters so I'm going to plug that in for V now equals an n n stands for the moles and that's what we're solving for it says how many moles so we're going to use that as our unknown R is that constant that we talked about 0.0821 liter atmospheres promote Kelvin and then T is for temperature 27 degrees Celsius we need to convert that to Kelvin so when you add 273 that becomes 300 kelvins now we can do the algebra from this point this is just a math problem so multiply and then divide both sides by 24.63 and we get an answer that n the number of moles equals about 162 moles of gas inside that container so once again we've mined the information out of the problem we've plugged it into the equation and then we solve the answer using our calculator now let's try another problem this one says what volume will 12.0 grams of oxygen gas O2 occupy at 25 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 0.520 so once again we're going to have to plug into PV equals nrt so P is for pressure and it says the pressure is 0.520 atmospheres I'm going to plug that in there for p v is for volume now we're solving for that because it says what volume so that's our unknown now N is a number of moles of gas does the problem tell us how many moles of gas we have it doesn't does it says 12.0 grams now we can convert that but we have to go kind of off to the side here and convert that separately so kind of off to the side here I'm going to take the 12.0 grams of oxygen O2 and let's convert that to moles now that's something that we learned how to do way back in unit one so that shouldn't be too difficult so grams on the bottom and one mole on top and how many grams are in a mole of o2 well we can look at the periodic table and it's O2 so we have to times this value by 2 it's about 32.00 grams in a mole so when we cancel grams and divide we find that we have .375 moles of oxygen that's the number that gets plugged in here for n so be aware that you may have to do a mole conversion and that's normal that's very typical R is still our gas constant 0.0821 liter atmospheres per Mo Kelvin and T is for temperature and that temperature is 25 degrees Celsius now I've got to change that to Kelvin so that once again that's 298 kelvins and so now we can do our multiplication and our division and we can solve for the volume and you can plug that into your calculator make sure that you're getting the same answer I am the volume should be about 17.6 liters so once again we can do an ideal gas law problem where there's a little bit of of converting to do let's do one more example this one is a little bit different this one says in grams per liter calculate the density of oxygen gas O2 at 25 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 1.00 atmospheres so this is very different isn't it the density and so you might be wondering how do we do the density because density is it says it's grams per liter and we don't really have a grams variable in here do we well there is something that we can do to get grams into this problem you might notice that we have n standing for the number of moles hopefully you would agree that to find the number of moles of of anything basically you take the number of grams there are and you divide it by the molar mass would you agree with that hopefully you would so what I'm going to do is I'm going to substitute in place of n in place of this mole variable here grams divided by the molar mass okay that's all I've done so far just made that little substitution now V is liters all right so I'm going to rearrange this equation so that I have grams per liter basically grams divided by volume and so when I do that I'm going to have to bring the V to the opposite side the same side as grams I'm going to have to bring the RT and the m m to the side as the P so when I do that the equation looks like this this is just a simple algebraic reorganization of that equation so G over V grams divided by liters equals pressure times the molar mass divided by RT I've just rearranged the equation so now G over V that's my density so to find the density all I have to do is take pressure in atmospheres times molar mass divided by RT and that's it so the pressure well it's 1.00 atmosphere and so I plug that in there and the molar mass well I need the the periodic table again for O2 it's about 32.00 grams per mole so I'm going to plug that in for my molar mass next I have the r which of course is still 0.0821 that hasn't changed and my T temperature is 25 degrees Celsius in Kelvins that's 298 kelvins so now all I have to do is use arithmetic to solve for this 1 times 32 divided by 0.0821 divided by 298 and so I get an answer that the density of oxygen at these conditions will be 1.31 grams per liter so make sure that you're getting that answer as well we have worked several problems with the ideal gas law in their applications hope you learned something here hope you enjoyed the video if you did please smash that like button the thumbs up and join me in my next video in which we're going to talk about

He works several problems throughout the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hu2xBrbgjU&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=26,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we're continuing with unit 3 section 4 the last video in this section actually as we talk about the partial pressure of a gas now let's imagine that we have a gas container that looks something like this and this gas container has a whopping 10 molecules of gas in there so you can see the 10 molecules and three of those molecules are blue triangle molecules we'll call them and then seven of those molecules are red X's as you can see in the container now if I were to ask you what percentage of the pressure is due to the Red X molecules well I think you would be able to say that it's 70 percent right because 7 out of the 10 molecules in that container are red X's and likewise if I were to ask you what percentage of the pressure in that container is due to the blue triangle molecules well once again it would be three out of the total 10 which is 30 percent this is telling us how we determine the partial pressure of a gas this is the premise behind Dalton's law of partial pressures now Dalton's law of partial pressures basically tells us that the partial pressure of a gas is equal to the fraction the mole fraction that that gas is taking up in the container multiplied by the total pressure so partial pressure is the pressure that a certain gas is responsible for the x that we have written here is the mole fraction or the the fraction that that gas is occupying out of the total and the P total just represents the the total pressure in the container so we're going to use this equation Dalton's law of partial pressures to determine uh the the partial pressures of some different gas containers or different gases in a mixture so let's take a look at the first example now here it says a flask has a total pressure of 1.25 atmospheres if the flask contains 7.2 moles of water vapor and 12.9 moles of carbon dioxide gas then what is the partial pressure of a water vapor and B carbon dioxide let's do part a first now what I recommend that you do this is something that helps me I like to draw a diagram of what's going on here so I'm just going to draw a little diagram or bring this up here and this is a very simple diagram I just have written that there are 7.2 moles of water in here and 12.9 moles of carbon dioxide gas and there's a little pressure gauge on there I've just drawn in that has 1.25 atmospheres as the total pressure so we're trying to solve for the partial pressure of water here in this first part in part A so let's find the the mole fraction that water is taking up now notice it's 7.2 moles of water out of how many total how do we get that well we have to add these two values together 7.2 plus 12.9 that gets us 20.1 total moles it's like in that other example with the x's and the triangles we had seven x's and we had three triangles what was the total that we divided by to get that that fraction we divided by the 10 right that was the total so we have to add them up same thing here divide it out and now we multiply this by the total pressure which is 1.25 atmospheres so when you divide the fraction 7.2 divided by 21 20.1 and then Times by 1.25 atmospheres the answer that hopefully you get on your calculator and I double check is about .448 atmospheres hopefully that's what you're able to get now let's try the other one carbon dioxide it's done the same way we take the fraction that the carbon dioxide is responsible for this time it's not 7.2 it's 12.9 moles divided by the total that total is still 20.1 the sum of those two mole values is still the same and then we multiply it by the total pressure in the container which is still 1.25 atmospheres and we key this into our calculator and when you take 12.9 divided by 12.1 times 1.25 check this on your calculator it should be .802 atmospheres now a way to check our work is to make sure that the two partial pressures of these components add up to give us the total pressure in the container and so is that the case if you take the 0.448 atmospheres and add that to 0.802 atmospheres does that give you the total pressure in the container it does doesn't it so that's the way we can check our work the total pressure should always be equal to the sum of the individual partial pressures in this case we only have two gases other gas mixtures might have three or four or who knows how many now let's take a look at another example in this case we have a gas chamber that has a total pressure of 1.800 atmospheres if 10.00 grams of oxygen gas O2 and 10.00 grams of nitrous oxide into o are present in the chamber what will be the partial pressure of a oxygen and B nitrous oxide so once again I'm going to draw a little a picture that kind of reflects what's going on here we have 10.00 grams of oxygen and 10.00 grams of n2o and there's a little pressure gauge 1.80 atmospheres and this is just to help us visualize what's going on here do you notice something different about this it doesn't have moles it does it it tells us grams gives us grams can we work the problem in grams well no there's no such thing as a gram fraction that we can work with here it has to be a mole fraction so the first thing we have to do before we can do anything in this problem is convert those two values to moles so we can have a mole fraction so that's a little extra work so off to the side we're going to have to convert these so let's just go ahead and do that 10 grams of oxygen and we have to convert that to moles so grams on the bottom one mole on the top and once again you can look at your periodic table and see that it's going to be about 32 grams in a mole of that and when you divide it it's 0.3125 moles of oxygen and we're going to do the same thing for the nitrous oxide 10.00 grams of n2o and grams on the bottom one mole on top to convert that to moles and when you add up the the molar mass of two nitrogens and an oxygen you should get an answer of about 44.01 grams in a mole of that compound somewhere very close to that so grams are out and when you divide this I'm getting a value of about 0.2272 moles of n2o so make sure that that's the answer that you're getting for moles as well or something very close to that now once we have the mole values we are ready to start our calculating so let's do part A and find the partial pressure of oxygen so for oxygen it's the mole fraction of oxygen so that's however many moles of oxygen there are 0.3125 divided by the total moles and how do we get the total moles again well we have to add these two numbers together so .3125 plus 0.2272 gets us 0.5397 total mold that's our this is our mole fraction now we can multiply the mole fraction by the total pressure in the container which is about 1.800 atmosphere so when I multiply that out I get an answer of 1.042 atmosphere so that's the partial pressure of the oxygen now let's do the nitrous oxide it's done the same way we take the mole fraction of the nitrous oxide so that's however many moles of that we have 0.2272 divided by the total moles in the container we just added that up a minute ago that number hasn't changed it's 0.5397 total moles and we multiply that by the total pressure in the container which is still 1.800 atmospheres and when you do that math you get an answer of about .758 atmospheres and so there we have our two partial pressures in this container now let's check our work because if we did this correctly the two partial pressures should add up to give us the total pressure is that the case is 1.042 plus 0.758 equal to 1.800 atmospheres it certainly is so that tells us that we probably did this problem right now let's do one more problem and here we have a laboratory problem here we have a chemistry student who has collected 0.1395 grams of gas over water in an experiment the student runs the experiment at 25 degrees Celsius and 50.00 milliliters of gas are collected today's atmospheric pressure is precisely 756.0 millimeters of mercury the vapor pressure of water at 25 degrees Celsius is 24.0 millimeters of mercury and we have three parts to the question so the first question says calculate the partial pressure of the gas in atmospheres now in the other problems we were expected to use the mole values and have a mole fraction we're not given anything with moles here so we can't do that what we're going to have to to do here is think about this in terms of the two gases that are present and they're going to add up to give us the total pressure so there are two components whenever you collect a gas over water what you're collecting in that container is gas but you're also collecting some water vapor because water is always evaporating so our total pressure will be the partial pressure of the gas that we're trying to collect plus the partial pressure of the water vapor so this is actually a gas mixture so it says the total pressure today's atmospheric pressure that's the total pressure is 756. so I'm going to put that in as my I'm trying to find the partial pressure of the gas so that's that's my unknown and the partial pressure of the water vapor is actually given to us in this little nugget of the problem right here that's the vapor pressure so I plug in the 24 millimeters of mercury and when I subtract I'll find out the partial pressure of the gas that I'm actually trying to analyze so that's going to end up being about 732 millimeters of mercury so that's my answer but I have to be very careful here because that's not what the question was asking for it says in atmosphere so we have to go a little bit further here and convert this to atmospheres so in my conversion factor when I convert millimeters of mercury to one there is one atmosphere equal to 760 millimeters of mercury now if you don't know that or you've known that and you've forgotten it don't worry because that piece of information that conversion factor is given to you in the equation packet on the AP exam so you don't have to memorize that if you know that number that's great but if you don't that's okay so when you divide 732 divided by 760 your answer is about 0.963 atmospheres so that's the answer to part A that's the actual partial pressure of the gas that we're trying to analyze now let's go on to Part B determine the number of the moles of gas the way we do this is using the ideal gas law now we've done several ideal gas law problems already PV equals nrt we're just going to have to plug in chug here now P the pressure of the gas well we just calculated that that was the 0.963 atmosphere so that's going to go in there now V is for volume do we see how many how many liters of gas we collected well it was 50 milliliters so we have to convert that to liters so that's 0.05 liters hopefully have the right number of sig figs on that now it's equal to n the number of moles well we're solving for the number of moles so we're going to have that as our unknown now R is the gas constant that's 0.0821 and then T is for temperature and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius that's the temperature at which we ran the experiment so we've got to change that to kelvins that's 298 kelvins so we have all the Nuggets of information that we got right out of the problem and in one case out of part A now we just have to solve for this so I'm going to multiply these out divide and hopefully you get the same answer I do as about .001968 moles so that's a very small number but that seems to be the right answer now part C says calculate the molar mass of the gas in grams per mole now for a lot of students this is a tough one because grams per mole what does that mean well the key actually lies in the unit right here grams per mole that means grams divided by moles the per actually means divide by so if I have the grams of gas and I actually do it says right here it's 0.1395 grams of gas so that's how many grams how many moles of gas well I just calculated that in Part B so that's the number of moles so when I take the number of grams divided by the number of moles I'm going to get the molar mass in grams per mole and that turns out to be about 70.9 grams per mole and so that's the answer now if the question were to ask identify the gas we could try to to find a a gas that has that that molar mass I would take a guess and say it's probably chlorine gas cl2 because that's a gas that has a molar mass very close to that so here we've done several examples with Dalton's law of partial pressures hope you've learned something if you have please hit that Thumbs Up Button we're going to head right on in the next video to unit 3 section 5 where we're going to learn a little bit more about the motion of gas molecules thanks for watching and I'll see you on the next video,"4,363",0,26
"Kinetic-Molecular Theory & Graham's Law - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 5","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses how the kinetic-molecular theory applies to states of matter, especially gases.  He then shows the application of Graham's Law of Effusion to questions about gases in AP Chemistry.  Throughout the video he works several problems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3nEzAUWqfE&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=27,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we are going to consider unit 3 section 5 which is all about the motion of gas particles now here we have a graph that you're going to see a few times over the the course of AP Chemistry this is called a boltzmann distribution curve and what you're seeing here is the distribution of the rates of the molecules of a gas as you change the temperature so on the left side here we have a curve that represents 100 kelvins and that's very cold and notice that almost all of the molecules are moving very slowly there are just a few molecules that are moving faster than 500 meters per second all of them almost all of them are very very slow once you increase the temperature up to 200 kelvins notice what happens we have a greater fraction of the molecules that are moving faster at 500 it gets even higher a thousand it gets higher so notice that at a temperature at any temperature we have a range of molecular motions some are always going slower some are going faster but the average kinetic energy the average speed is higher when you raise the temperature so that's why we say generally speaking when you raise the temperature the molecules are moving faster and that is what we see reflected in this boltzmann distribution curve now the question why is the area underneath each of the curves the same well this has to do with the fact that we're talking about the same sample of gas and so we should have the same number of gas molecules for each temperature all we're doing is raising the temperature so we just have the distribution is you know flattened out and it seems to be attributed toward the the front side much more as you raise the temperature higher velocity now could you draw in with the curve at 750 kelvins would look like could you interpolate that and draw that in hopefully you could you can basically just draw it in here in between the 500 and the 1000 temperature curve there and just draw in that boltzmann distribution curve like I said we'll come back to this a couple times throughout this course this just gives us a way to see the distribution of the speed of the molecules as you change the now when we talk about temperature and heat we want to remember that these are not the same thing they are related to each other but they're not the same thing temperature is an actual numerical measurement of the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a material so this is a phrase that we've seen before already in this course average kinetic energy that that phrase is interchangeable with the word temperature so if you see a question that says which of these samples has molecules with greater average kinetic energy it's just asking you which one has the higher temperature that's all it's asking for in the SI framework of measurement we measure temperature in kelvins and as you're aware there are other units that we use as well degrees Celsius a degrees Fahrenheit who knows what other units of temperature can be used now the neat thing about kelvins and this is one of the reasons why we like to use the Kelvin scale when you double the temperature in kelvins that shows us that the kinetic energy of the molecules has also a doubled as well so if it goes from 100 kelvins to 200 kelvins you have literally a doubled the kinetic energy of the molecules and if you double the temperature in celsius you can't really say that so that's one of the neat things about the Kelvin scale on the other hand Heat is specifically the form of energy that's transferred between two systems at different temperatures this is sometimes called thermal energy and we'll talk about thermal energy and heat quite a bit more once we get to unit 6 about thermochemistry and thermodynamics now heat is measured not in kelvins or degrees Celsius we measure heat in joules and there is a relationship between joules and and kelvins we'll talk more about that once we get to the thermodynamics unit here in here in the future of this course so so let's take a look at the relative rates of effusion of different gases now there is a gas law that helps us to figure this out this is called Graham's law of effusion and Graham's law of the fusion states that the rate of movement of gas particles is inversely proportional to their molecular mass now what that means is the and this is the equation for that by the way it looks a little bit intimidating but it's not as as bad as it looks I'll show you how this works in a minute what this is telling us is as the molecular mass of a gas goes up the rate of its motion goes down and likewise as the molecular mass of a gas goes down its rate of motion goes up so this is basically telling us in so many words that lighter gases move faster and heavier gases move slower and at some level I think that makes sense that heavier gases are going to be lumbering along because those are heavy molecules they just don't go as fast and lighter molecules well they can go very fast so let's take a look at some of the words here because you might not know what effusion means we might know what diffusion means how diffusion means going from an area of higher density to an area of lower density but effusion is a little bit different from that effusion is the escaping of molecules through a very tiny hole in a material so a good example of this is like if you have ever gotten a helium balloon and you know that that helium balloon once you buy it is is floating it looks nice it's all plump but you also know that after a certain number of days in some cases a number of hours after you buy the helium balloon it starts to get less plump and sometimes that helium balloon actually starts to sink it doesn't float as well and it starts to sink well what's happening well the helium atoms inside that balloon are escaping that balloon and they're escaping through very teeny tiny holes in the walls of that container now we're talking about extremely small holes like on the order of like the size of an atom or not much larger than the size of an atom in some cases so that's that's what we're talking about here the escaping of atoms or molecules so a very tiny hole and that's how helium in this case effuses outside of that balloon now like I said Graham's law basically tells us that heavier molecules are going to do this a whole lot more slowly heavier molecules move very slowly and lighter molecules move very fast and so that's what Graham's law tells us and so we're going to work a couple problems here with Graham's law and this is the first one it says which gas effuses faster nitrogen or helium and how much faster so we have rate of a over rate of b equals the square root of the molecular mass of gas B over the square root of the molecular mass of gas a I would strongly recommend that you choose the lighter gas to be gas a that way the math is going to work out so let's think about nitrogen first of all here's the periodic table Square for nitrogen and hopefully as you know nitrogen is diatomic so it's actually in two and so it's like of a mass is actually twice that number so it's about 28.01 and helium is just h e it's it's not diatomic it's just he and it's molecular mass is 4.00 so can you look at those and tell me which one is the lighter gas what's helium isn't it and so that's the gas that's going to infuse faster it's going to be helium so we know that much that's that's half credit right there but let's do the second part of it let's let's figure out how much faster so I'm going to plug in helium as gas a since it is the lighter gas and I'll put in nitrogen as gas B since it is the heavier gas now once again helium since it is the lighter number has to go down here they're kind of across from each other there on the diagonal and then nitrogen the 28.01 will go in the numerator so we have this so all I have to do now is plug square root of 28.01 divided by square root of 4 into my calculator and when I do that I get an answer that's very close to about 2.65 and so this is the ratio this is telling us that helium gas effuses 2.65 times as fast as nitrogen gas and that's all you have to do this equation looks fairly intimidating but all you have to do is find the molecular masses of these gases and then just plug them in you know larger number square root over the smaller number square root and get the ratio so hopefully that's not too difficult let's try another example that is a little bit more challenging this time we have helium can Infuse 2.245 times as fast as a gas with what molecular mass so this is a little bit different because in this problem it actually comes right out and tells us which gas is faster all right it tells us that helium is going faster than some mystery gas that we don't know what it is we're trying to find out what is that that molecular mass now the faster gas is also the lighter gas so I'm going to plug in helium as gas a and then gas B we'll call it X because I don't know what it is yet and we're going to use these these values here for our square roots now we know what the molecular mass of helium is isn't it it's 4.00 just like it was before so I'm going to plug in the square root of 4.00 in the denominator down here now I don't know what the mystery gas is so in the numerator it's going to be square root of x and we know what the ratio is because the problem tells us it's 2.245 so that's our our ratio so now if we look at this equation we have a fairly simple algebra equation if we can set the 2.245 over 1 we can cross multiply and when we do that we get a value of square root of x equals 4.490 so go ahead and make sure that that's right as you calculate that yourself now to solve for x I have to square both sides so if I Square both sides that's going to lift the square root sign off of this if I Square this number and I get that x equals about 20.2 atomic mass units so that's my answer now the question doesn't ask me to do this but I could go one step further and try to identify the gas and my best guess is probably going to be neon because that's a gas that is very close to 20.2 atomic mass units so notice that using Graham's law of effusion I can look at the relative rates at which these gases move and I can actually figure out what gas I'm talking about so a pretty neat little calculation there I hope you learned something about the way that gases move and the behavior of gases in this section if you learn something please give me a thumbs up and I hope to see you in my next video in which we move right on to to unit 3 section 6.

"Deviation from the Ideal Gas Law - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 6","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses what is an ideal gas, and how real gases differ from ideal conditions.  He also discusses at which conditions real gases approximate ideal conditions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGTzkVDcHI&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=28,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we are moving on to unit 3 section 6 which is about the differences between ideal gases and real gases now in the last several videos we looked at gas laws and probably the most important gas law is the ideal gas law PV equals nrt and maybe we wonder what is an ideal gas because that might seem like somewhat of a of a strange name to give a gas law what makes the gas law ideal is it just better than the others or what well an ideal gas specifically refers to a gas that first of all has molecules that take up no space so that's that's one requirement for an ideal gas secondly an ideal gas has molecules with no intermolecular attractions for each other so those are the two requirements for an ideal gas so that makes us Wonder do ideal gases really exist in the real world and we have to admit the answer is a big no on that because all molecules take up space now some molecules take up more space than others but all molecules take up space and all molecules have intermolecular attractions for each other now under some conditions different molecules may have more or stronger attractions than others but all molecules have intermolecular attractions for each other so ideal gases don't really exist and as a result the ideal gas law as we try to apply it to the real world is actually imperfect and there are some some flaws in it now it is true that under some circumstances like we said earlier real gases that exist in the real world can approximate ideal conditions now that first requirement was that ideal gases deaf molecules that don't take up any space now in the real world there are some molecules that get pretty close to that there are several molecules that have very small molecular size and they just don't take up that much space and these are molecules like you see on the screen here like neon or helium or hydrogen those very very tiny molecules that don't take up much space and as a result they are pretty close to Ideal not ideal but pretty close to it and also the second requirement is that these molecules don't have any intermolecular attraction to each other well like we said all molecules that have have a certain amount of Attraction but under certain conditions they may have very little intermolecular attraction for example if the molecules are moving so fast they just whiz past each other and hardly have any time to have an attraction to each other that's high temperature when those molecules are moving so fast they have very little opportunity to interact so at high temperatures real gases approximate ideal conditions and if the molecules are so far apart they're spaced out so far apart that they're unable to really have much attraction to each other that's another condition that's that's low pressure so we say that at high temperature and low pressure real gases can get pretty close approximate ideal conditions now just so you know there is an equation that compensates for the differences between real gases and ideal gases because a lot of gases and in fact a lot of conditions in our Laboratories just will not approximate ideal conditions very well so we do have an equation that compensates for that that's called the van der waals equation now if you look at this equation you'll notice that it's basically PV equals nrt except for the pressure we are correcting it with these other variables the N squared a over V squared and we're correcting the V the volume with the NB now we probably know what n and V are but what are A and B well a is a factor that corrects for intermolecular forces and the factor that's labeled B corrects for the actual size of the particles themselves and these are constants that are different for every substance and so those are those are constants that you would have to look up depending upon the gas that you're working with now the good news if you're taking AP Chemistry is that the van der waals equation is not an equation that you're going to ask to be used to solve or actually use on the AP exam you need to know that it exists and you need to know the conditions at which real gases approximate ideal conditions it would be very rare even in a first year General chemistry course in college to have a student actually have to to work something out with the van der waals equation or at least more than once or twice hope you enjoyed the video hope you learned something about real gases versus ideal gases if you did please give me a thumbs up I will see you in the next video in which we're going to move on to so Solutions and solution chemistry so join me for that video as we head on to unit 3 section 7.,"4,282",0,28
"Solutions and Mixtures - AP Chemistry Unit 3, Topic 7","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses various units of solution concentration, and focuses on how students can calculate the molarity of a solution.  He works several examples and shows students how to use the 'dilution equation' to solve problems involving the dilution of concentrated solutions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob4zGMCVIM&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=29,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and welcome to AP Chemistry unit 3 section 7. in this section we're going to be learning about mixtures and how we talk about concentration of those mixtures now before we jump into Solutions we need to remember that mixtures are materials that contain more than one substance and so we might think of a salad that's a mixture or a cheeseburger or a hamburger that's a that's a mixture or if you think of Kool-Aid or some other solution salt dissolved into water that's a mixture now there are two types of mixtures the first type is a heterogeneous mixture and that's a mixture in which the individual components of that mixture are visible to the naked eye and those individual components we call those phases so for example if you're looking at a salad I suppose we could say that the lettuce would be one of the phases and the tomatoes would be another phase and the the Cucumbers would be another phase heterogeneous mixtures have phases that you can see with the naked eye now the other type of mixture this is the one that we're going to going to be focusing on in most of this section homogeneous mixtures these are mixtures where the components have been mixed together so well everything is uniform all the way through what that means is you cannot see the individual components with the naked eye so if you have Kool-Aid or salt dissolved in water you cannot see the little specks of Kool-Aid powder or in the salt water you cannot see the little crystals of salt because they've been dissolved so uniformly throughout the whole mixture that's what homogeneous means everything is uniform throughout the whole volume of the mixture we call homogeneous mixtures Solutions that's another word for these and that's a word that we're probably going to use much more commonly we normally think of solutions as being a solid dissolved in a liquid it's not always the case sometimes they are perhaps several gases essentially dissolved into each other like air air is a good example of a solution that contains pretty much all gases we can think of solids as being Solutions as well Alloys we talked about Alloys in a previous lesson those are solutions because they are solids that have been mixed together and everything is uniform throughout that think about brass you know sterling silver it is uniform you can't see the individual parts or or phases of that so Solutions there are lots of types of Solutions in this course we're mainly going to be focusing on solids dissolved into liquids and generally speaking the liquid that we're going to be using is water almost all of the time now one of the most useful ways for talking about a solution is to think about its concentration when we say concentration that's how much solute is dissolved into the solvent the solute is the usually the solid in in most cases and the solvent is the the medium into which the solid or the the solute gets dissolved most of the time like I said the solvent is water there are lots of units for concentration formality is actually the name of one a molality is another name percent by mass is another one molarity percent by volume normality these are all very good ways of talking about concentration now in this class in AP Chemistry we're going to spend most of our effort thinking about molarity now all those other units or ways to describe concentration are good as well but we're going to focus on molarity in AP Chemistry now the way that we calculate the molarity is with this equation right here molarity equals the moles of solute divided by the liters of solution in your in your solution and if you use that equation you can calculate molarity very easily now that's the primary unit of solution concentration there are other contexts in which we use the others but like I said in this course and in most of chemistry molarity is a very important unit and so that's how we're going to solve this let's let's solve a problem let's say we have a student that produces a solution by adding 0.711 grams of tin two chloride to enough distilled water to make 75.0 milliliters of solution calculate the molarity of this solution so once again it's moles divided by liters so we have to take the 0.711 grams of tin two chloride that we have given to us and convert that to moles before we can actually do our calculation so let's do that and that means that in our conversion factor grams have to go on the bottom we'll put one mole on top we can use our periodic table here to find out how many grams are in one mole of that stuff and when you add it together one tin atom and two chloride atoms I get a total of about 189.62 grams in one mole of that substance so when I divide this out I get .00375 moles now since it's moles divided by liters I have to take this mole value that I just calculated and divided by liters now not milliliters I have to convert it so 75 milliliters is the same as point zero seven five zero liter so when I divide that out I get an answer that the molarity is about .05 0 0 molar so that's how you solve molarity these are calculations that you should be able to do fairly simply fairly straightforward let's try another one in this case a chemist dissolved 2.556 grams of zinc chloride in enough distilled water to produce 250.0 milliliters of solution what is the molarity of this solution so once again we're going to have to take the gram value that's given to us here and convert that to moles so we take the 2.55 five six grams of zinc chloride we have to use our periodic table again to convert that to moles so grams on bottom one mole on top and when I add one zinc and two chlorines together I get about 136.31 grams per mole of that substance so when I divide this out I get .01875 moles that's how many moles I have now the next step of course is to calculate molarity by taking moles divided by liters so I have moles how many liters do I have well move that decimal point three places over and it's 0.250 liters so when I divide this out on my calculator I should get an answer of about .07500 molar so that's how you calculate molarity of a solution now sometimes you're given the molarity and you're given either the grams or moles and the volume and you have to solve for the other one so here's an example like that a small Beaker contains 50.00 milliliters of 0.250 molar sodium hydroxide solution if the solution is allowed to dry how many grams of sodium hydroxide solid can be retrieved so we're just trying to figure out how many grams of sodium hydroxide are essentially locked up into this solution all we have to do is first of all convert to moles just like we did before so we're going to start with our 50 milliliters but we need to write that in liters it's .05000 liters and we're going to use molarity as a conversion factor now this is something that we're going to do later on when we're talking about reactions and how Solutions can react sometimes so in my conversion factor I'm going to put liters on the bottom and I'm going to put moles on top since I'm converting to moles now notice that 0.250 molar means 0.250 moles per liter so I can actually put these numbers into the conversion factor I'm actually using the the molarity as a conversion factor here so I'm going to cancel liters and when I multiply these numbers by each other I find out that it's .0125 moles so once I have moles I can convert to grams fairly easily now there is a shortcut here and I'm bringing this up because we're going to be doing a lot of this type of calculation once we get into acid-base titrations and solution chemistry later on molarity times liters equals moles I'm not sure how much of a shortcut that is but if you remember that and you just take the molarity times liters that's a very quick way to get the moles you know just take the 0.05 times 0.25 and you'll get the same answer which is essentially what we did but you just need to remember that moles equals molarity times liters now once we have moles we can of course convert to grams and we just take the .0125 moles of sodium hydroxide and we're going to convert that to grams and of course we use our our periodic table for that so moles on the bottom grams on top and when you add these together it's about 40 grams per mole of this substance so when you cancel moles and multiply .0125 times 40 gets us about 0.500 grams of sodium hydroxide so if you take that solution and allow it to dry out you can expect to retrieve about half a gram of sodium hydroxide solid that's how you would solve that it's just using the definition of molarity now let's take a look at another example with molarity this is a very common case that we have in the laboratory especially those of us who have to make solutions for for a class for a lab a chemist needs to produce 500.0 milliliters of 0.250 molar hydrochloric acid solution how many milliliters of concentrated 12.0 molar hydrochloric acid solution should be used to create the desired solution this is a very common example that we carry out in the laboratory we purchase acid and a lot of solutions for that matter in concentrated bottles so they might have a bottle of concentrated acid and we use that to dilute it down and make more dilute solutions that we might use for a class in chemistry so the first thing that you want to do is just like we always do convert to moles so I'm going to take the 500 milliliters which is half a liter and multiply that by 0.250 molar of the solution to get the number of moles so when I do that I find that I need .125 moles of the acid solution so with that I'm going to take the moles and I'm going to determine the volume now we know that molarity equals moles divided by liters we can rearrange this equation just using simple algebra to where it looks like this liters equals moles divided by the molarity just it's the same equation just are rearranged I'm trying to find the volume the moles well we just calculated that 0.125 and the molarity of our original solution is 12 molar so when you divide that out you get an answer of .0104 liters now the question was how many milliliters so we have to multiply this by a thousand and we get that it's 10.4 milliliters so that's another type of problem with dilution now some folks have a little trouble remembering which molarity to use when and when to do which Step there's another equation that actually makes this even easier and oh just as a caution never add water directly to concentrated acid always add acid to water there is a shortcut and this is this is the equation it's m1v1 equals M2 V2 and this is what I call the dilution equation all you have to do is plug the numbers into the equation and you will solve and get the right answer every time so in this case the starting molarity is 0.250 molar and by the way it doesn't matter what you call the ones and the twos in this case it's I suppose it's actually the ending of molarity is 0.250 molar and the volume of that stuff is 500.0 milliliters the other molarity in this case the starting molarity is 12.0 so I plug that in there and I'm trying to find the volume of that so V2 is my unknown and so I just use Simple algebra to solve for this and I get the exact same answer in fact I don't even have to convert to liters if I put milliliters in for V1 my V2 will be in milliliters as well so it's the same answer but I think this is a little bit easier so hope you learned something about types of mixtures and how we work with Solutions and the molarity calculation as well if you learned something please shoot me a thumbs up and leave a

"Representations of Solutions - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 8A","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses the main types of solutions and reviews the concept of solution concentration.  He introduces the concept of mole fraction as a way of measuring the concentration of a solution and works some examples with mole fraction.  Video Featuring Supersaturated Solutions:      • Supersaturated Solutions - Working wi...  ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W19S_PQOqgw&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=30,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and welcome to AP Chemistry once again we are heading into unit 3 section 8 which is about the types of solutions and how substances react when they're placed into solution now there are two important components in pretty much any solution there's the solvent and then there's the the solute the solvent is the medium into which a solute gets dissolved so in our last video we said that most of the time in AP Chemistry and in most of chemistry in a a fairly typical laboratory you're working with water as the solvent most of the time the solute is whatever substance gets dissolved into the medium now most the time we think of the solute as being a solid it doesn't have to be it can be a gas it can be other liquids but most of the time we think of solids being dissolved into water when we think of a solution solute and solvent now water is the universal solvent that means that if you have enough water and you have enough time water will dissolve just about anything if you have enough of it um we also know that water is the solvent that we use in at least in in high school chemistry the vast majority of the time that's what we usually dissolve things into and that's probably the case around the home as well so as we look at these two solutions we have two fairly identical flasks it seems but we have there there is a difference between the two solutions here these are both copper II sulfate can you tell which one is more concentrated I think you can tell can't you just by looking at this just by eyeballing this you can tell that the one on the right is more concentrated and that's because the color has a deeper blue now because of that how are the particles that make up the mixture different well hopefully you realize that in the more concentrated solution the particles of solute are closer to each other and in the one on the left what we call the dilute solution the particles of the solute are farther apart and so light actually diffuses differently based upon the the concentration of these and so from our point of view as we see this with our eyes the one that has the higher concentration is going to have the deeper blue color now there are important types of solutions that you need to be aware of we've already mentioned a couple of these dilute dilute means a solution that has a relatively low amount of solute in it so if you look at this with your eye it's probably going to have a paler color if it is a colored solution not all solutions that are are going to have a color of course that we can see with our eyes but dilute a fairly low amount of solute on the other hand concentrated Solutions have a relatively high amount of solute and we just talked about how that's going to look from your point of view of your eye now dilute and concentrated are relative terms this solution here we would call dilute but if you were to water this down and have a solution that were even more dilute than this you might say well this solution right here is more concentrated than the other one it's all relative and we could say the same thing for this this other concentrated solution perhaps there's another one that's even more concentrated and this one might be a dilute it's basically just a Continuum as we talk about types of solutions now eventually if you keep adding solute and keep dissolving the solute into the water into the solvent you're eventually going to get to a point where that solvent can't hold any more solute where it has just had enough it's not going to dissolve any more solute and that's called saturated and a saturated solution is a concentrated solution but it's a it's it is a special type of concentrated solution it has dissolved the maximum amount of solute for that temperature now usually at higher temperatures more solid can be dissolved into a liquid uh that makes it saturated if you see a saturated solution one of the ways that you can tell it's saturated is that probably someone has tried to dissolve more than it's supposed to and it's just not dissolving it's just sinking down to the bottom of the beaker and so this is a good sign that we have a saturated solution where the there's a solid that's just sank down to the bottom and it's just not going to dissolve anymore now there is another type of solution this is this is one that may seem a bit paradoxical but it does exist sometimes this is called a supersaturated solution and this is a concentrated solution that has temporarily dissolved more than the maximum amount of solute for that temperature now you might wonder how in the world is that possible well essentially you have to trick the solution into dissolving more than it's supposed to hold and the way you do this is by raising the temperature so normally at higher temperatures you can dissolve more solid into water so you raise the temperature using a hot plate or something and you just keep dissolving and dissolving and dissolving and dissolving this solute into the liquid more than it would normally at room temperature then you cut the heat and then you slowly allow that temperature to drop and once it's when it's back down to room temperature temporarily it will dissolve more than it's really supposed to it's you've basically tricked the solution into holding more than it's supposed to now the problem with this is that it is usually very unstable which means if you just uh perhaps add a seed Crystal to it or jostle it around too much or just let it sit there for too long it will crystallize out and it will flash crystallize almost instantaneously and this is what we have here if you see something like this this is the a supersaturated solution in the process of flash crystallization so I have a video about that I will link that into the description and I'll post it at the end of this uh video here as well where I have prepared a supersaturated solution you can see how that is done that it's actually pretty neat there are some supersaturated solutions in the real world that are quite useful like supersaturated sodium acetate it's used as a chemical heat pack um also fudge if you've ever eaten eaten fudge that's a good example of a super saturated solution being created now we've talked about molarity already so I don't want to to beat that that uh once again but let's take a look at mole fraction this is another way of talking about concentration and X is going to represent the mole fraction we saw that back in the Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure section right well X just represents the mole fraction it's a ratio it doesn't have any units so that's kind of nice now the moles of the substance will go in the numerator and then the total moles that means the sum of all the moles of all the components in the solution that includes the solvent too will be in the denominator so that's how you find the mole fraction of a substance let's try an example here we're going to calculate the mole fraction of sucrose c12h22011 in a solution where we have 10.00 grams of sucrose dissolved into 400.0 grams of water so we're solving for the mole fraction we have to find out the moles of both of these items because it's not gram fraction it's mole fraction so we have to take the 10 grams of sucrose and convert that to moles and we're going to have to do the same thing for the 400 grams of water too so 10 grams of sucrose grams on bottom one mole on top if you add up the molar mass using the periodic table you get something very close to about 342.3 grams in one mole of sucrose so when you cancel grams top and bottom and divide you get .02921 moles of sucrose so that's the value of our moles for sucrose let's try converting 400 grams of water to moles now yeah 400 grams of water you have to do the same thing here so grams on the bottom one mole on top it's about 18.02 grams in a mole and that's 22.2 moles of water so now we can actually solve the problem we take the moles of sucrose and put that in the numerator and then in the denominator it's the total mole so these two mole values that we got added together and when you add these and then divide the top by the bottom you should get an answer of about 1.314 times 10 to the negative third so that's the mole fraction of sucrose in this solution and notice there are no units mole fraction is a ratio so it is a unitless function hope you've learned something about mole fraction and how we describe Solutions if you did give me a thumbs up in my next video we're going to be continuing unit 3 section 8 as we talk more about what ionic compounds and other compounds as well do when they are dissolved into water thanks for watching I will see you next time,"3,433",0,30
"Electrolytes, Nonelectrolytes, & Dissociation into Ions - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 8B","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how ionic compounds and other strong electrolytes dissociate when dissolved in aqueous solution.  In this video, students will know if a compound will dissociate into its ions in aqueous solution.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFkcOaPpRHk&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=31,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and welcome back to AP Chemistry we are in unit 3 Section 8 in this second part of that section we're going to learn about how compounds react and how they behave when they are dissolved in water now we want to spend quite a bit of time on Solutions here because usually when we carry out a reaction in the laboratory it's going to be in Solution that's that's how we we carry out a whole lot of reactions in the lab and that's just because substance tend to react more readily when they're in solution as a result we have a special word a vocabulary word here that talks about what it means to be dissolved into water the word aqueous specifically means a substance that has been dissolved into water Aqua of course that means water doesn't it so we're talking about substances that are dissolved into water if you see an AQ in parentheses written after a substance that means that substance has been dissolved in water and we'll see that as we start writing these equations here later on now just an example of that before we we jumped into that in a later lesson if you have salt just regular sodium chloride in its solid form you'd write it as NaCl with this little s in parentheses to represent that it's a solid once you dissolve it into water though well it actually becomes NaCl aqueous you put the AQ in parentheses to show that it's been dissolved in water but that's not it something else happens as well since this is an ionic compound and it is dissolving in water it's going to do something else it's actually going to break apart or dissociate into its component ions and so what you're really going to have will be sodium ions that are aqueous and chloride ions that are aqueous and so we're going to learn how to write these in aqueous ionic form you know ionic compounds that means something that that has a metal and a non-metal cation and anion they are strong electrolytes so what that means is when they dissolve in water they dissociate completely into their component ions just like we we see here in the case of sodium ions and chloride ions and we call them strong electrolytes because this solution right here is going to conduct electricity very strongly the presence of those charged particles will allow electrons to flow quite freely allowing it to conduct electricity and we can actually test that very easily in the lab using a simple battery and a conductivity tester now normally when we talk about ionic compounds dissolving this happens when you have usually it's water but it could be some other polar molecule as well and actually surround the ion and literally pulls it away from the ionic crystal lattice and so here's a picture or a cartoon I suppose you could say of what's Happening here so let's imagine that we have a salt crystal so here's sodium chloride once again and we know that sodium ions those are positive they tend to be smaller than negative ions and so the sodium ions would be these little purple spheres here and the chloride ions which are negative would be those somewhat larger green spheres so let's imagine that we have a couple of water molecules I'm sure there are more than just two but we're just going to focus on these two and how is it going to behave around that sodium ion right there well it's positively charged and so that means that the negative poles of the water will surround that sodium ion and will literally Pull It Away into solution and that's how water can dissolve an ionic compound now the same thing happens with the anions imagine that we have this chloride ion right here and we're going to focus on two water molecules over here this time it's the positive poles so notice it's the positive poles of water that will surround that chloride ion right there it's going to do the same thing it's going to literally pull those those ions off into into solution now this force is something we call an ion dipole Force hopefully for Fairly obvious reasons at this point we have an ion that's being attracted to a dipole or to a polar molecule now this only happens if the ion dipole force is stronger than the force that holds the ion together in the ionic compound and that's why some ionic compounds don't dissolve in water because their ionic force is so strong well that ion dipole Force even that is not enough to pull them away so in salt yeah this ion dipole force is much stronger than the force that's holding the sodium and the chloride ions together now when we get into writing chemical equations which we're going to be doing quite a bit in unit four we want to get in the habit of writing soluble ionic compounds in ionic form so what that means is for example if you have zinc nitrate and it's dissolved into water you don't write it like this you write it in its ion form ZN 2 plus aqueous plus two nitrate ions aqueous notice it's two nitrates because there's that little two right there that shows that we had two nitrates present where if we have sodium sulfide you'd write it as two sodium ions and it's two because of that little subscript 2 right there along with a sulfide two negative ion how about lead to acetate well lead to ion and this time it's two acetate ions I'm leaving off the aqueous in parentheses just for brevity's sake but normally you would put that in there as magnesium fluoride you'd write that as a magnesium two plus ion along with two fluoride ions just like that now if you were to stumble across a compound that is insoluble one that does not dissolve in water like calcium phosphate well if it's insoluble then it can't dissolve of course and it can't break apart into its ions and so you would just write it as its normal ionic compound form now perhaps the question is how do you know if a compound is soluble like the first four were or insoluble like the last one well in the next unit unit four we're actually going to learn some rules that will help us to predict if something is soluble or not so stay tuned for that as we move forward to unit four but for right now we're not going to worry too much about that now there are some other compounds that should be written in ionic form in aqueous solution strong acids now we're going to spend a lot of time on acids once we get to Unit 8 of this course but for right now we're going to talk about the fact that there are six strong acids and these are the six strong acids that you need to know for AP Chemistry hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid hydroiodic acid nitric acid sulfuric acid and perchloric acid and these are the only six acids that will dissociate completely into their ions when they're in aqueous solution so in each case of these six they would be written in ion form just like you see in these examples that's how you would write them every other acid and there are hundreds if not thousands or more acids out there every other acid is going to be written in its compound form because it's not going to dissociate very much all other acids are what we call weak electrolytes they just don't ionize very much we talked about strong acids how about bases well strong bases are also strong electrolytes and they will dissociate completely as well they're going to break apart into their ion form once again there aren't that many strong bases out there there are only eight and here they are and for the most part they are if you look at the formulas here you'll see that these are essentially the group one and group two hydroxides lithium hydroxide sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide rubidium hydroxide cesium hydroxide calcium hydroxide strontium hydroxide and barium hydroxide and notice in each case since these are the strong bases they're going to dissociate completely they break apart into their component ions notice in these last three here you have two hydroxides so you have to reflect that whenever you write the ion form now some folks might be asking about francium hydroxide it's extremely rare and it honestly doesn't exist if it did exist it would be a strong base as well as far as I can tell some folks might be looking at some of these other hydroxides and be asking about some of the others in one case it's radioactive and doesn't really exist beryllium hydroxide is not really soluble and magnesium hydroxide really isn't that soluble either so for our purposes these are your eight strong bases all other bases that you're going to encounter all other hydroxides all other bases are weak electrolytes and honestly do not ionize very much now most weak bases that you're going to encounter in AP Chemistry are going to have nitrogen and hydrogen in them and we'll see that once we get to the acid base unit in unit 8. but for right now if you see a compound that has nitrogen and hydrogen like ammonia or hydrazine or methylamine in this case those all have n and H so those are I mean that's a good tip off that these are weak bases and we'll talk more about what that means and how they behave in solution later on in this course now all other molecular compounds including water are what we call non-electrolytes and they honestly do not ionize much at all in fact they honestly do not ionize so things like sugar or dinitrogen tetroxide or methane these these hydrocarbons or glucose all those compounds especially hydrocarbons anything that's organic those are non-electrolytes and we're not going to expect a whole lot in fact really any ionization out of those water we'll talk about that here in the acid-base section quite a bit carbon dioxide these are things that just really do not ionize the reason that we're talking about this is that strong electrolytes conduct electricity very well when you dissolve them in water so take an ionic compound take a strong acid take a strong base dissolve it into water you can pass a current of electricity through that very easily and that's because you have all these ions swimming around and those charged particles give a nice conduit for those electrons to pass through on the other hand weak electrolytes weak acids weak bases and non-electrolytes all these all these here they do not conduct electricity at all hope you learned something about how substances behave when they're dissolved in water about electrolytes and weak electrolytes and non-electrolytes if you learn something please hit that thumbs up button that really does help the algorithm and join me in my next video where we're going to move on to unit 3 section 9. thanks for watching,"3,050",0,31
"Chromatography, Distillation, & Solubility - AP Chem Unit 3, Topics 9-10","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to separate mixtures, focusing on distillation and chromatography.  In the second part of the video, he discusses various factors that affect the solubility of substances in a solvent.  He introduces students to the concept of 'like dissolves like.'",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWxgxb-RHTE&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=32,hi there I'm Jeremy Craig and welcome back to AP Chemistry unit 3 we are combining sections 9 and 10 in this video which is about basically mixtures and how they are made and how they're separated as well a section 9 of unit 3 talks about a couple of ways to separate mixtures now sometimes you can separate mixtures just very easily just by literally a picking out the different parts of the mixture if you have a salad for example and tomatoes and lettuce and and cucumbers or whatever else you put in there it's pretty easy just to pick out the different parts or phases of the mixture however if you have a solution a homogeneous mixture that can be a little bit more difficult so in this little picture of this cartoon here what we're doing is we're actually separating parts of a solution and the method that we're using here is called distillation and in distillation we normally have two sometimes more than two liquids and we're going to separate these from from each other now notice that these two components they are liquids and they have two very different boiling points in this case component a is actually ethyl alcohol which has a boiling point of about 78 degrees Celsius and component B is water which has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius so what you do is you take this mixture and just put it into a beaker or some sort of a container and you put a lid on this there's actually a special type of flask that will do this and you can heat it up this is just a little flame here and we're heating this up and the goal is if you could take the temperature of this the solution here to about oh somewhere between 78 and 100 degrees Celsius what's going to happen is all of component a should boil away and component B will mostly not boil away so component a is going to be boiling away and so that's the The Vapor that we have here and then once it gets up to a certain level here we actually run some some cool water over the tube this is called a condensing tube and that causes the vapors here to condense back and so we have recondensed vapor and so if we do this properly we should have mostly component a over here which is our ethyl alcohol and then in the original container we'll have component B which is the water so this is how distillation Works we're basically separating one component from another based upon boiling points or different boiling points that they have that's distillation now in another method of separation of a solution this is called chromatography and the basic idea behind chromatography is you have a mixture and usually this is a small amount of of the solution that we're going to to separate and you have some sort of a column in some forms of chromatography this column might be just a few inches long A few centimeters long in some cases this column might be several meters long maybe even dozens of meters long depending up depending upon the type of chromatography excuse me so what you have is some sort of a mixture that mixture is inserted into the column usually there's something in the column that helps the solution to separate the components either way what's going to happen is these multiple components will pass through the column at different rates and so in this case the somewhat Green Arrow here that represents component one that passes through the column very quickly and so we can perhaps make a a collection of some sort or collect or make a reading of that component and then later component 2 is passing through the column more slowly so it exits the column later that's essentially the idea here behind chromatography often you're separating maybe more than two perhaps a dozen components I don't know but that is possible with different types of chromatography so that is what you need to know about separating mixtures now in our next section section 10 in unit 3 we're learning about how we know if something's going to going to dissolve into something else now a very nice rule of thumb for that is like dissolves like dissolves like now the idea behind that is that if you have a polar solute it's going to dissolve in a polar solvent now the most important polar solvent that we need to know about is water that's what we sometimes call the universal solvent and if you have a polar solvent like water polar molecules are going to dissolve very easily into that polar solvent now once again how do you know if something is polar or not well it goes back to drawing those Lewis electron dot diagrams that we talked about back in unit two you have to draw that out and if it's polar that means it has an unbalanced region of negative charge then it's polar and it's probably going to dissolve into something that's polar like water so examples of that would be like we see ammonia and ethyl alcohol on the other hand if it's a nonpolar molecule like these hydrocarbons they're generally not going to dissolve into water and the other way around works as well so if we have a nonpolar molecule like the methane or the Benzene there's a good chance it's going to dissolve much more easily into a nonpolar solvent like carbon tetrachloride on the other hand if you try to take those polar molecules like ammonia and ethyl alcohol they're probably not going to dissolve very well into a nonpolar solvent so that's what we mean when we say like dissolves like now on an exam you don't want to use that as an explanation like dissolves like is a very good mnemonic aid but it's not a reason that's not the reason why one thing dissolves into something else we'll talk more about the reasons here later on now let's apply this rule which of the following molecules would be expected to dissolve in water and we have a few examples here now the idea here is to remember that water is a polar solvent so what's going to dissolve in water well it should be polar solutes and carbon tetrafluoride if you draw it out it's Lewis electron dot diagram is not polar at all everything is nice and balanced out is a perfect tetrahedral structure so that's not going to dissolve into water how about sodium chloride well yes most of the time we know that ionic compounds especially those that start with an Alkali metal they're going to dissolve into water so yeah that that is going to dissolve how about this one here this is acetylene and normally when you see a hydrocarbon like this with just carbon and hydrogen it's nonpolar so it's not going to dissolve into water and if you want to see that nonpolar structure you're of course welcome to draw out that structure and see what that looks like and you'll see that it is perfectly nonpolar there are no unbalanced regions of electrons there how about HCL now that is polar isn't it if you draw out the Lewis electron dot diagram there you'll see that there is a lopsidedness to it the electrons tend to gather around this chlorine it has a nice octet so yeah it is going to dissolve into water very well and how about nf3 well if you perhaps remember back to the section on Lewis electron dot diagrams you might remember that that is a trigonal pyramidal structure and so yeah that is a polar molecule so it is going to dissolve into water the key is knowing if something is polar or nonpolar if you're not sure draw out the Lewis diagram and you can see for yourself now when we talk about solubility it's good to get some generalizations here let's think about how solids dissolve in water as a function of temperature now if you look at this graph here we can see that the normal relationship between solubility and temperature is a positive correlation what that means is as you raise the temperature it gets more soluble and we can see that because for almost all of these curves as you go to the right the curvature goes upward some of these are more pronounced than others some shoot up pretty high like in the case of potassium nitrate some have a more steady perhaps a lower slope like sodium chloride but that's normally how it goes as you warm up a solution you're going to be able to dissolve more solid into that solution now does this match your experience I hope it does you might have experienced this if you've ever taken perhaps some sugar and tried to dissolve it into some iced tea some people like to to have their tea sweet and if you dissolve sugar into iced tea you'll find that it doesn't dissolve very easily in fact usually what happens is that Sugar will just fall down to the bottom of the glass and you'll really have to to stir that that glass of tea quite quite vigorous in for a rather long time to get that sugar to dissolve sugar just doesn't dissolve very easily in iced tea now what about hot tea try dissolving some sugar into hot tea it's the same solution essentially but the only difference is it's hotter and you'll probably or if you've ever had hot tea you know that yes sugar dissolves very easily into hot tea you raise the temperature you raise the amount of of solid that can dissolve into the solution now are there any exceptions to this rule well there is an exception on this graph isn't there in fact we see that there's one that as you heat it up it gets actually less soluble and that's the case with cerium-3 sulfate that's an exception and there aren't too many solids like this but this is one notable exception that kind of proves the rule I suppose you could say now let's think about how gases dissolve as a function of temperature you'll notice that this is the opposite instead of all these curves going uh going upward they're actually going the opposite direction they're going kind of downward aren't they and so as we see here as you take a solution and warm it up it actually is able to dissolve less gas so think about that in the case of oxygen or methane or pretty much any of these as you warm up the the liquid all of a sudden you get less gas that's able to to dissolve in that solution and there is a practical application of this concept if you've ever had an aquarium or some sort of a fish tank you might know that it's not a good idea to get the the water very warm especially in the summer time if you do that less oxygen will dissolve into the water and the fish can actually start to die because of that in fact that's a reason why thermal pollution is such a problem in lakes and rivers and streams because if the the temperature of that body of water increases by a fairly appreciable amount all of a sudden less oxygen can dissolve in that water and the fish literally cannot breathe and so the fish start to die and we actually see this happening in some places in very warm climates where the temperature in the summertime Rises and lakes and streams they just don't have enough dissolved oxygen and you start to have fish dying and so that's a good application of this now let's think about solubility of gases as a function of pressure now we said that as you raise the temperature you're going to have less gas dissolved but it goes the opposite for pressure the more pressurized a container is a solution is the more gas you can dissolve into that solution the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas directly over the solution so you increase the pressure you increase the solubility of that gas and you might see an application of this in a bottle of of soda and so if you ever if you've ever had a soft drink like Coca-Cola or Pepsi or your your favorite soft drink you might realize that there are a bunch of gases in fact there's one main gas carbon dioxide dissolved into the soda and that's because you have closed the cap over there and you have a high a fairly high pressure over that liquid and so you can dissolve a lot of gas into that soft drink well what happens as soon as you open that that lid and release the pressure well when the pressure goes down the solubility of the gas goes down as well and you start to see Fizz and that's how that works lower pressure over the soft drink means you have less gas dissolved and so the gas that was dissolved in there will bubble out and that's why you have the Fizz that's produced now there's another application of this as well maybe you've been scuba diving or you know of someone who has gone scuba diving the farther down you go below the surface of the water the higher the pressure is and so when there's higher pressure on you well that means that more gases can dissolve in your bloodstream and if it's something like oxygen that's not too big of a deal but there are some gases like nitrogen uh in in one example that will dissolve a whole lot more readily in your blood at higher pressures Down Under the surface than on the surface and so the problem is if you rise to the surface too quickly those bubbles of nitrogen will actually start to form and your blood will perhaps not quite like this but your blood will it will literally start to Fizz this nitrogen gas and that's again that is a condition called the bins and it can be very painful and in some extreme cases it actually can be lethal and that is a direct application of Henry's law so in this video we've taken a look at solubility of gases and solids and looked at the factors that cause things to dissolve it and we've also looked at how to separate mixtures as well hope you enjoyed the video if you did learn something please shoot me a thumbs up hope to see you next time as we move ahead to unit 3 section 11.,"4,437",0,32
"Waves, Light, and Photons - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 11","In this video, Mr. Krug shows how visible light is a fundamental part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  He also shows how different types of electromagnetic radiation affect molecules in different ways.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2bG4AdDbKM&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=33,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we are moving on to AP Chemistry unit 3 section 11 which is about the nature of light now you may have seen this graphic or something similar to it before this is essentially the visible light spectrum in terms of the wavelength in nanometers and so if you see green light just as an example what you're seeing is light that has a wavelength of somewhere around 525 nanometers when you're seeing uh yellow light then you're seeing uh what you're seeing is visible light at a wavelength of uh somewhere around whatever that is around 580 nanometers somewhere in that area if you see uh violet or purple light it has about 400 nanometers as its wavelength every color of light corresponds to a specific wavelength and we can actually measure that using instruments now whenever we see light the fact is this is just a very small part of the electromagnetic spectrum in fact if we look at this and of course this is a basically a logarithmic scale here so it's not to a an actual uh linear scale but if you see visible light in here you see that really this is just a sliver of the entire electromagnetic spectrum and so if you go beyond if your eyes could somehow see beyond red or at wavelengths that are uh longer than red I suppose you could say you'd be seeing infrared now most of us can't see that with our eyes it goes that is something that our human eyes cannot see uh if you were to go even longer waves you'd have microwaves and you've probably heard of microwave ovens well microwave ovens use these microwaves in order to cook food essentially keep on going you have radio waves and and TV waves now if you go to uh to light that has a wavelength shorter than violet then you have ultraviolet so somehow if you could see the wavelengths that are shorter than violet that's ultraviolet and it keep keep on going smaller you have x-rays that have even smaller wavelength and and gamma rays are even beyond that and so these are probably uh types of light or types of electromagnetic radiation that you've probably heard of at some point or another you need to know that ultraviolet X-rays and Gamma those have uh much more energy than visible light infrared microwave and radio waves generally have less energy in their waves than visible light now when we think about the nature of light we think of a couple of scientists you've probably heard of of Albert Einstein and he's one of those as well Max plank is another one that we need to be thinking about when we discuss light he was a German physicist who studied electromagnetic R uh radiation and the nature of light now Plank's postulate basically says that any type of electromagnetic energy such as visible light or any of those other types of electromagnetic radiation are only emitted in quantized form now what does that mean well Quantum or quantized form refers to the fact that it can only exist in little nuggets or chunks or packets and we have learned over the last century or so that this is actually how it works energy and light exist in these packets and anytime you see a ray of light or electromagnetic radiation is being given off it's been given off in multiples of these little nuggets or chunks or packets we call these photons and so what you're seeing is a bunch of photons if you see light or a a ray of light with your eyes now this is um this is to be contrasted with something that is continuous just as an example of this if you've ever walked down a ramp you know that a ramp is continuous you can literally stop at any position on the ramp and that's perfectly fine on the other hand a Quantum scale would be something like a staircase you know that if you're climbing a staircase or going down a stair case you know that you can only stop on a step on one step above it one step below it on any step but you have to stop on a step it is impossible to shall we say levitate between the steps and that's what Quantum is in light we have Quantum packets here you have nuggets or chunks of light and that's how that is the the nature of light now we need to realize also that different types of radiation have different effects on atoms and molecules for example if you have ultraviolet light or even visible light that causes electrons to jump or transition to different energy levels and so you may have a this is actually called a Quantum Leap when this happens you have an electron and it's energized by visible light or ultraviolet light it literally caus elect to jump to different energy levels it causes them to transition now if you have something that has less energy like infrared radiation well it's not going to cause those those electrons or those molecules to do quite as much it will cause those molecules to vibrate and so infrared radiation causes vibration now once you get to even lower energy like microwave radiation that can't even cause molecules to vibrate it only causes them to literally rotate and so that's all that's happening your molecules are rotating in microwave radiation maybe you're wondering well if this is the case why do we use microwaves to cook food well that's because the uh energy in the microwave oven that's being emitted has the same um energy as the wavelength that causes water molecules to rotate and that's just enough energy to cause friction and that causes the the uh the water and inside the food to heat up and so here we have these different types of radiation you do need to know the effect that each of those types of radiation has on molecules and atoms Hope you join me next time as we go on to unit 3 section 12 which is about wavelengths and how we calculate that if you learned something from my video please shoot me a thumbs up and I hope to see you next time as we

"The Nature of Light - Waves, Photons, & Energy - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 12","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students the different features of waves, as well as how wavelength and frequency are related. He introduces Planck's postulate and shows how it is possible to calculate the energy of a single photon of electromagnetic radiation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trlFDyrjtOQ&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=34,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we are moving on to AP Chemistry unit 3 section 12. in this section we're learning about the nature of waves and how to make some calculations with those electromagnetic waves as well so here we have a picture of a wave and we know that we can calculate the wavelength of the wave by literally taking the the distance from one point on the wave and finding the distance to the exact same correlating point on the next wave so in this case I'm going from Crest to Crest and that's the wavelength or you could go from trough to trough as well and get the exact same value for the wavelength we usually measure wavelength in meters and the symbol for wavelength is this Greek letter Lambda now as we look at this wave right here we can see that the wavelength is much shorter isn't it has a much shorter wavelength and as a result it has it has what we would say a higher frequency now frequency refers to how many wave Cycles hit a certain point per second we have to remember that these waves are always in motion so if you imagine a perhaps a line or a point here and this wave is moving over the course of Time how many of these ways will pass that line over the course of a second well that's the frequency now the the symbol for frequency looks kind of like a letter V that's actually the Greek letter Nu and that is our symbol for frequency now if we take a look at electromagnetic waves as opposed to like waves on the ocean or sound waves or something like that we find that pretty much all electromagnetic waves move at the speed of light and we can relate the relationship between the wavelength and the frequency with this equation right here C is the speed of light C stands for celeratos which in Latin means swiftness now the speed of light is about 3.00 times 10 to the 8th meters per second that's 300 million meters per second that is really fast now like we said earlier the Lambda represents the wavelength how long the wave is literally and that's measured in meters we use M for meters and then the new there that is the frequency and that's how many wave cycles per second pass a point like I said over the course of a second and that's measured in hertz now there are a couple different ways to express Hertz we can just write it as you know a reciprocal seconds s to the negative one you can write out the word Hertz or HZ also works as a good value for that notice the relationship between wavelength and frequency they're next to each other on that same side of the equal sign which means that they are inversely proportional to each other one goes up and the other goes down so the higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength and the longer the wavelength the the lower the frequency is going to be now let's take a couple examples here let's imagine that we have an FM radio station that broadcasts on a frequency of 96.9 megahertz determine the wavelength of the radio waves emitted by this station's antenna so once again we're using the equation C equals Lambda times Nu and we're just going to plug and chug into this equation here so C is our speed of light so that's 300 million meters per second 3.00 times 10 to the eighth and then the wavelength over here the Lambda that's what we're trying to solve for it says determine the wavelength so that's going to be our unknown the frequency the new here is the 96.9 megahertz but notice we have to write it in hertz not megahertz so Mega means a million so it's 96 million 900 000 Hertz so when we plug these into our equation we can solve and get the answer quite easily and find that the answer for the wavelength is about 3.09 meters so that's how we can solve for that that means that if you could somehow see the wave that was being emitted by that antenna it would have a wavelength of just over 3 meters let's try another example let's say we have a red laser pointer that emits a light at a steady wavelength of 670 nanometers what frequency is the light that's being emitted by this pointer well it's the same type of problem we're going to use C equals Lambda Nu and we're going to plug into that equation so C is the speed of light which is once again 3.00 times 10 to the 8th meters per second we know what the wavelength is this time 670 nanometers now we know that a nanometer is 10 to the negative ninth meters so probably the easy way is just to write this as 670 times 10 to the negative ninth meters now you can put that into real scientific notation but your calculator will do that for you either way now if the frequency the new that's what we're solving for so we can plug that in as our unknown and just do a a simple division and you'll find that the answer is about 4.5 times 10 to the 14th Hertz so that is the frequency for this this particular laser pointer take this one step further we've learned the relationship between the wavelength and the frequency but what about something else let's take a look at the actual energy that's being packed in the photons of these of this light here is the relationship between the energy of a photon and its frequency it is directly proportional and all you have to do is take the frequency of the light and multiply it by H now that is something that we call Planck's constant the energy of a single Photon in joules is equal to Planck's constant times the frequency Planck's constant is equal to about 6.63 times 10 to the negative 34th Joule seconds that's a very small number which means that every little tiny Photon out there has a very small amount of energy we're talking about a very small packet of energy but once you have a lot of these then you have of course a lot of energy of course the new represents the frequency which is in wave cycles per second or or Hertz as we've talked about now that means that if we know the frequency we can figure out the energy of a photon and likewise if we know the energy of a photon we can figure out the frequency as well and you know what if we know the frequency we can backtrack and even get the the actual wavelength for that too so let's try this problem right here if an AM radio station broadcasts on a frequency of 1 340 kilohertz to determine the energy contained per photon in its electromagnetic waves so once again we're going to use the equation E equals H times Nu so e is what we're solving for since it says determine the energy so we're going to solve for that now H is Planck's constant which is 6.63 times 10 to the negative 34th Joule seconds and the new well that's the frequency and that's 1 340 kilohertz now a kilohertz is a thousand Hertz so this is basically you know 1 340 times a thousand Hertz if you want to calculate that it's actually something like 1 million three hundred forty thousand or you can write it something like this if you prefer all we have to do is multiply as you can see and when we do that we find that the energy of a single photon is 8.88 times 10 to the negative 28th joules so once again that's a very small amount of energy and that makes sense you would expect one Photon to have a very small amount of energy if you did the answer or I did the problem and got some huge number here you you would know that you're doing something wrong during World War II it was discovered that some Pilots could detect infrared light they found that infrared radiation at a wavelength of 1160 nanometers was interpreted by the naked eye as a pale greenish light calculate the energy of a single Photon of this light now notice that our equation E equals H Nu will relate energy to the frequency but we're not given the frequency we're actually given the wavelength so the first step we have to do here is figure out what the frequency is we know the wavelength we can use C equals Lambda Nu to determine the frequency so we can plug and chug joints just like we did in that other equation and C of course is the speed of light 3.00 times 10 to the 8th meters per second the wavelength is 1160 nanometers which is 1160 times 10 to the negative ninth meters and we're trying to solve for the frequency so we can divide that out and we find that the frequency is 2.59 times 10 to the 14th Hertz well now once we know the frequency then we can plug into the other equation E equals H times Nu we're trying to find the energy of the photon so we're solving for e H is Planck's constant which is 6.63 times 10 to the negative 34th Joule seconds and our frequency our new well that's what we calculated in the first part of the problem the 2.59 times 10 to the 14th Hertz so now all we have to do is multiply across and we find that the energy of this photon is 1.71 times 10 to the negative 19th joules this is a two-step problem but if you're fairly Adept at working with this algebra here you shouldn't have any problem at all solving that let's try one more problem here we're going to look at a photoelectron spectroscopy graph now we did this earlier on in the course way back in unit one but this is a good review because we need to keep remembering how to do these problems let's label this PES diagram and we're going to identify the element that we have here now remember if you can write an electron configuration you can label a PES diagram all we have to do is go from left to right it goes 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4S and so those those Peaks are labeled left to right just like you'd write an electron configuration in that very same order and remember the height of the peak represents the relative number of electrons we have notice that all these s Peaks have the same height so that tells us that they all have two electrons in them and the three or these uh two P Peaks the two p and that three p they're three times higher which means they have three times as many electrons so it's 2p6 and 3p6 and if you look at the electron configuration that we've basically just written here we know that that is the configuration for calcium it ends with 4s2 now let's take this one step further let's calculate the wavelength in meters of electromagnetic radiation that's needed to remove an electron from the valence shell of an atom of the element how do we do that well let's think about the valence shell which Peak would that be well that would be the very last peak in this case the 4S Peak and notice that there is an energy associated with those electrons 0.979 times 10 to the negative 18th joules well if we know the energy in joules then we can use an equation E equals H Nu to calculate the frequency can't we and if we know the frequency we can determine the wavelength as well so let's use the equation E equals H Nu to determine the frequency of this light so we're just going to plug and chug the E the energy is right there in the graph it's 0.979 times 10 to the negative 18th joules the H is our Planck's constant which is seconds and we're trying to determine the frequency here so we just use Simple algebra and divide and we find that the frequency of this light is 1.48 times 10 to the 15th Hertz now if we know the frequency we can determine the wavelength can't we we use speed of light equals Lambda times Nu so we just plug into that equation so the speed of light is 3.00 times 10 to the 8th meters per second we're solving for the wavelength and we just calculated the frequency as 1.48 times 10 to the 15th Hertz do a simple division and you'll find that the wavelength is 2.03 times 10 to the negative seventh meters or if you prefer you can convert that to nanometers and that's about 203 nanometers and if we think about how that would plot on our electromagnetic spectrum well this is the visible light spectrum and 203 nanometers is a little bit off of this and so it's beyond Violet so I think it's safe to say that this frequency or this this light would be in the ultraviolet range so this is a nice application of a question that they might ask you on an exam like an AP exam or some other type of exam about wavelength and frequency and energy of a photon I hope

"Spectrophotometry and the Beer-Lambert Law - AP Chem Unit 3, Topic 13","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how spectrophotometry works and how chemists can use a spectrophotometer to determine the concentration of an unknown substance.  He shows how to determine the appropriate wavelength to use in an analysis and how to avoid common mistakes about this topic on exams.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD3_pN5gR8A&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=35,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we are moving right along in our AP Chemistry course we are in unit 3 section 13 which is about a certain type of chemical analysis called spectrophotometry now when we talk about analyzing a chemical mixture or carrying out some certain type of chemical analysis sometimes it's just as simple as placing something on a scale weighing it seeing how much is in there doing a simple calculation sometimes though when we analyze mixtures or substances in the chemical laboratory we have to use a certain indirect method and that the method that we're going to be talking about in this section is spectroscopy now later on in this course we are going to talk about acid-base titrations and that's an important chemical analysis method that is covered in in AP Chemistry this is where you take usually an acid or a base until something very visible takes place like a color chain change from an acid-base indicator that shows that the reaction is complete but like I said in this section we're going to be looking at spectroscopy and the idea is using the intensity of a color to determine the concentration of a solution I think intuitively we understand that you can do that for example if you take a look at these five mixtures if we were to say that they're all the same substance the only difference is the concentration I think it's pretty obvious that the last mixture over here is by far the most concentrated and likewise the one on the far left is the least concentrated the intensity of the color lets us know that that's the case well that's basically what a spectrophotometer does the idea here is that we're looking at not just our own eyes but we're using an electronic eye to determine the intensity of a color that's basically what spectral photometry is in in so many words now the instrument that we use to determine or Analyze That intensity of the color is something we something that we call a spectrophotometer and with that information we can make some very simple calculations to determine the concentration of the solution that we have now let me show you how this works the idea behind a spectrophotometer is that you take a light source and we're talking about a I mean a fairly run-of-the-mill light bulb that we have inside this instrument and we allow the light to pass through a color filter and we're able to adjust the color we can adjust the frequency of that color fairly easily on the spectrophotometer and so once we've allowed that light to pass through the the filter we now have a different color light that's passing through there and we allow that light to pass through a sample of our solution this is the this is the sample that we're trying to analyze and that light is going to interact with the solution sample in such a way that's going to change that light in some way and then we take the light that passes through the solution sample with the cuvette and it's going to be detected by a light detector and so we can compare the intensity of the light that we had over here to the intensity of the light that we had starting out and we can determine the intensity of the color in that Solution that's the idea here now this is what the instrument actually looks like this is what you would see of course all of the parts that I told you about these are internal you don't see them all you have here is a little Port where we can place the the sample and we have a dial we have a few buttons there to do some uh some resetting some blanks but that's basically what a spectrophotometer looks like sometimes we call it a spec 20 that's a very common name for these now as we get ready to do these these calculations and these experiments one thing that you want to think about we know that oftentimes when you analyze a solution it's going to have different substances in there you you aren't going to have a a solution that has just one solute and that's it often there are multiple solutes that are dissolved in this solution and all of these are going to absorb light over a fairly wide range of different wavelengths and so let's say that we have a mixture that contains Cobalt two ions and copper two ions well we want to determine the concentration of the Cobalt 2 ions what frequency do we set that spectrophotometer at well we can take a look at the graph here and we can see that Cobalt ions will absorb over a fairly wide range there but its highest value is 500 nanometers now the nice thing about 500 nanometers is they have a very high or at least a relatively high absorbance for Cobalt ions but notice that there's very little interference from the copper II ions if we had set this to say let's say not 500 which is the correct answer but let's say that we had set it to I don't know 600 well then we're getting some of our readout from Cobalt ions but almost as much is coming from the copper two plus ion so we always want to use the frequency that has the highest absorbance with as little interference from any other substances as possible likewise if our job was to try to analyze the concentration of copper two ions can you see which wavelength would be the most appropriate in this case it's not 500 is it it's certainly not 600 either probably more like 800 or even a bit higher than that so if you want to use the appropriate wavelength whenever we're carrying out our experiments here now how do we use this method to actually figure out the concentration of a solution well it's actually fairly simple we use an equation called the beer Lambert law this is sometimes just called Beer's Law but we often called beer Lambert law this is how it's written and the capital A there represents the absorbance now this is a number between 0 and 1 and this is something that is read directly off of the instrument so it will actually give you this number on the spectrophotometer now this little thing that looks like an e is actually Epsilon and that is the molar absorptivity of the substance this is a constant and this is a constant that measures how well it absorbs light and so for some substances this will be low for some it'll be high but we can calculate that fairly easily now the letter B here represents the path link this is the width of the cuvette that we stick into the spectrophotometer now we have it written here as a variable but the fact is it's almost always going to be one centimeter and that's just because your spectrophotometer has a little door on it and it has a little opening and you have to stick the the cuvette in there and it's only so large if you try to stick a two centimeter cuvette in there it's probably just not going to fit it has a certain width almost all the time your cuvette is going to be one centimeter and that's simply because that's how these instruments tend to be built well the C that is the concentration of the solution that's can that's a measured in moles per liter molarity like we have learned already in this course so that's the beer Lambert law now let's see if we can simplify this a little bit now there are some things that for the most part are not going to change e or I should say epsilon here that molar absorptivity for substance at a certain wavelength is not going to so we can imagine that the Epsilon is not really going to to be much of a factor here as long as we keep the same wavelength and we keep this keep the same solution at a wavelength now the B is also something that should not change the size of the cuvette I mean we're not going to be changing the cuvette size over the course of an experiment we're going to use the same path length so Epsilon and B really should stay the same throughout the course of an experiment so what does that leave us with that leaves us with the fact that a which is your absorbance is directly proportional to concentration and in AP Chemistry that is the important part of the beer Lambert law that you need to know about in upper level courses this Epsilon and the B might become important and I suppose it's possible that they could ask you to calculate this but to be honest this is the important part in AP Chemistry and so the way this works is that if you take a graph and you have the concentration of the solution on the x-axis and the absorbance that you read out from the spectrophotometer on the y-axis you should get something very close to a straight line when you plot these values now the first thing that you always want to do in an experiment like this is prepare a blank what that means is you're going to have a cuvette that has only pure distilled water in there and when you put the pure distilled water in there and stick that into the spectrophotometer the absorbance should be zero and so we're going to put a plot of zero at the zebra basically that is the origin of our graph there are zero comma zero on your X Y axis now at that point you're going to prepare other Solutions of known concentration so you'll mix these up in the lab and then you'll stick these into the cuvette into the spectrophotometer and you'll plot their absorbances so for example if you make a solution that's 0.020 moles per liter its absorbance might be 0.10 and you might have another one here at this at this point you might have one at this point and when you do this you'll start to notice that we have something that looks like a straight line so you want to prepare a line here a best fit line now sometimes it's not going to look quite as pretty as you have here but usually it'll be pretty close and so you'll you'll have a best fit line in this case it looks almost like we're connecting the dots now when you have this calibration curve as it's called in this in this type of experiment now what you can do is use this line or this calibration curve to determine the absorbance of the solution with unknown concentration so you'll basically take your unknown here and stick this into the spectrophotometer and you'll get a readout of the absorbent so let's say that it reads out right here around Point uh around 0.27.28 is your absorbance you just run this over to your best fit line and you can drop that down and you can see that the concentration of your unknown is somewhere around .050 moles per liter and that's all you have to do so let's do a few examples here let's say that we have a student that is given a solid sample containing copper two plus ions she dissolves the entire sample in enough pure water to make 100 milliliters of solution she then measures the absorbance of the solution to be 0.50 determine the concentration of copper two plus ions in the solution do you see how to do that since the absorbance is 0.50 we just take 0.50 on the y-axis and pair that up to the calibration curve you can see that that bumps into the line right around here so I would say that the concentration of the copper two plus ions would be about 0.25 moles per liter so basically just read the graph that's all you have to do there now what if the question says determine the moles or the number of moles of copper two plus ions in the original solid sample that's not difficult either because we have the concentration and we have the volume it's 100 milliliters so all we have to do to find the moles would be take molarity times volume so 0.25 molar times 0.1 liters and that tells us that we have .025 moles of copper two plus ions in the solution let's try another example let's say that this time we have a solid sample containing iron three plus ions that's converted into 200 milliliters of a solution containing the dark red ion complex iron thiocyanate two plus and that's aqueous and the iron thiocyanate two plus ions have an absorbance measured at 453 nanometers as shown in the graph below so there's our our calibration curve and the question says if the absorbance of the mixture is 0.30 at 453 nanometers what is the concentration of the iron thiocyanate ions in the solution once again all we have to do is just read the graph so we take the .30 and we see that that is right around here and we just run this over to the line to the calibration curve and when you drop down you can see that this is right around looks like 6 times 10 to the negative fifth moles per liter so that's all you have to do just read the graph if we were to ask how many moles of iron three plus are in the original solid sample fairly simple all we have to do is take the molarity times the volume so once again 6.0 times 10 to the negative fifth moles per liter times the volume is 0.2 liters when you convert that to liters and you'll find that the answer is 1.2 times 10 to the negative fifth moles of the iron ions and so that's that's all you have to do to solve these problems now let's take a look at a more advanced question here here's a multiple choice question when using a spectrophotometer to measure the concentration of copper two plus ions in a sample the calibration curve shown below is produced which of the following most likely cause the error in the point plotted at .080 moles per liter copper now you see that there is an outlier here so why is there an outlier well let's let's take a look at the possible choices here and try to to figure out the answer so part A says or Choice a says the sample was contaminated by some point one molar copper solution would that have caused a point to be too low well no because you might remember that absorbance is directly proportional to concentration and if the concentration were too high which we have here 0.1 instead of 0.08 well the the absorbance would have been too high on the graph not too low so the dot would have been up here somewhere so it's not a Choice B says the student used a cuvette with a longer path length than the cube that used for the other Solutions and that's not correct either for a couple of reasons first of all you're not going to change the path link you aren't going to use a different cuvette links that would that would be very unlikely just unto itself but also we know that if the path length is longer that's B that would make your absorbance higher and so once again if the path length were longer the dot should be up here somewhere and it wouldn't be too low now Choice C says the student forgot to run a blank and that's not correct either because notice that we actually do have a blank there is a point at 0 0 the origin so there is a blank so the answer is not C Choice D says there was distilled water in the cuvette when the student put the standard solution in it that is correct because if you have distilled water in there that means that you're going to have a diluted solution and your concentration is lower than you think it is and that would give us a DOT that's too low so that is the correct answer D is the choice that you would select for that multiple choice question now you might have noticed that in most of these examples we're focusing on compounds that have copper ions Cobalt ions in some cases iron ions these ions are going to have colors that are in the visible range these can be detected by our Laboratory spectrophotometers normally the spectrophotometers that we use in the laboratory have a range that goes it takes the visible light spectrum into account and it goes a little bit beyond that and so more expensive equipment more expensive equipment rather can go a little bit beyond that but normally our spectrophotometers go from about 330 to a thousand nanometers so it goes a little bit into the ultraviolet range just a bit into the infrared range and the fact is if you want to spend about twice as much you can go even beyond that but that's still there is still a limit to what we can use this for now let's think about the ions that do have visible colors this is something that you often need to know and is very useful as you carry out your laboratory work in chemistry you need to know that copper ions generally tend to have blue colored Solutions nickel ions will have green colored Solutions iron ions will have yellow or orange colored Solutions chromium ions will have yellow or orange colored Solutions as well and Cobalt ions are going to have the pink Solutions also so these are some colors that you need to know and as you carry out more laboratory work in chemistry you will get to know these also just by your own experience and you might find that some of these Solutions are actually quite pretty so as we wrap this section up there's a lot in here but and this is a very important section about spectrophotometry but in summary you need to be aware that when you look at a spectrophotometry graph you want to double check to make sure that there is a blank make sure that there is a point at the origin zero comma zero to make sure that the blank has been carried out also you want to line up the absorbance with the calibration curve to find the concentration just reading the graph essentially if you're ever asked to find the optimal wavelength for an analysis like we had in that earlier example there you want to choose the the wavelength that has the maximum absorbance for that ion while also giving you the least interference from other substances as well and finally don't forget that if you have a lower concentration or lower concentration than you expect you would have it's often caused by contamination from water which has diluted down your solution and that's going to drop the absorbance if for some reason you have a longer cuvette length which is probably very unlikely but if that ever happens that's going to raise the absorbance so I hope you learned something about spectrophotometry in this fairly brief video hope you learned something if you did please smash the thumbs up button that really helps the algorithm and gets the word out about my videos thanks again we're going to move on in our next video to unit 4 section one thanks for watching,"5,802",0,35
"Introduction for Reactions & Equations - AP Chem Unit 4, Topics 1-2a","In this video, Mr. Krug describes key differences between chemical reactions and physical changes.  He also begins Topic 2, which is an introduction to the solubility rules that are necessary for predicting the products in net ionic equations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmI627EPza0&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=36,we're going to start unit 4 by taking a look at Section 1 which is about physical versus chemical changes now you've probably learned about these before in other science classes but this is something that you need to know about in AP Chemistry as well a physical change is essentially when a material undergoes a type of change that doesn't affect its chemical composition so that might include something like just changing something's appearance or its shape or its size something like taking a piece of paper and tearing it up or folding it or taking an object and moving it from one place to another these are all physical changes things such as phase changes like a melting or boiling or freezing or condensation sublimation these are phase changes where all you're doing is changing from one state of matter to another like solid to liquid or liquid to gas and A's are just physical changes as well all we're doing is moving or rearranging the molecules we aren't actually changing the molecular structure itself on the other hand chemical changes are when you take one or more substances and actually convert them into new substances so that would include things like burning or oxidizing or rusting or digesting now when you see a chemical reaction there are often some very telltale signs that a chemical reaction has taken place things like a color change so if you see something that changes from colorless to Pink for example that's a sign that a chemical reaction has taken place that color change tells you that a change in odor all of a sudden you start smelling something that smells rather unusual that you hadn't smelled before probably a sign of a of a chemical reaction that had taken place change in texture if something for example if you take a piece of paper and burn it perhaps that paper was nice and smooth before and then after it's burned it's all a brittle well that's a sign of a chemical reaction because a change in texture there production of light we often see that in the form of a flame but it can be in some other forms as well a bioluminescence or a chemooluminescence as well those are signs of a chemical reaction production of heat if you take a flame you know that if you stick your hand next to that you're going to feel some heat once again sign of the chemical reaction production of a gas that may be in the form of bubbles it may be in the form of smoke but once again a sign of a reaction producing a precipitate a precipitate is a solid that's formed from the mixture or the combination of two or more solutions and so a precipitate yeah that's a sign of a chemical reaction normally you'll see two or more of these things in a chemical reaction often I think intuitively we kind of know that these things tell us that every action has taken place if you have a sandwich for example and you put that in the refrigerator and then leave it there for a month and come back you may find that the sandwich has changed color maybe it was uh perhaps the what the bread was white and now it's it's green and maybe the odor has changed it doesn't smell very good and the texture has changed maybe it's not nice and fluffy bread but maybe it's slimy now and maybe there are even the bubbles being formed there well intuitively you know that a reaction is taking place and you really shouldn't eat that sandwich so these are signs of a chemical reaction now we're going to move right into section two here in unit four and this is about the actual solubility rules and how we talk talk about reactions and equations now we can talk about chemical reactions with just words if we really want to we can use this sentence here to talk about a reaction and say aluminum metal and oxygen gas react to produce solid aluminum oxide and that would be perfectly fine however it's more common to write this in terms of a chemical equation where we use symbols so we've seen some symbols like this before in this course already where we use chemical symbols for elements and chemical formulas in the place of compounds as well as some symbols like plus which means and or added to and the arrow which means yields and we can use some symbols inside parentheses to represent different states of matter like s for solid and G for gas AQ for aqueous if that were there means dissolved in water L for liquid now that's a very nice chemical equation but one thing we need to obey whenever we write a chemical equation is the law of conservation of mass that means that the numbers of an element on the left side of the equation needs to be equal to the number of atoms of that element on the right side of the equation and as you can see that's not really happening here like for example we have two oxygen atoms and we have three oxygen atoms on the other side we have to balance that and we do that by placing coefficients in front of the substances so in the case of oxygen if we could multiply this by 2 by putting a 2 in right there in that spot and then multiply this one by three well now we have six oxygen atoms on both sides sites and so the oxygen atoms are balanced now of course we have to do the same thing for the aluminum atoms we only have one aluminum atom on the left side but we have four you know two times two is four on the right side so we have to multiply that left aluminum by four and now we have a balanced equation so whenever you write an equation make sure that you go ahead and do that extra step and balance the equation now when we look at equations and reactions in AP Chemistry we're going to find that most of the reactions that we deal with are in solution that means that it's often not going to be elements that are reacting but rather it's ions that react because as we've already said in this course if you take an ionic compound and dissolve it into water all of a sudden you have ions swimming around and that's what's going to react that aqueous solution acts as a better conduit for the reaction to take place so let's take a look at how different substances dissolve now as we've already said in this course water is the universal solvent that means if you have enough water and enough time most things are going to dissolve in water eventually now you need to know some of the solubility rules for ionic compounds because this will help you to write equations as we move into the next part here in section two now the first rule this in fact these first two rules are probably the most important ones of all the first one is that all nitrates are soluble that means that if you see a compound that ends with NO3 that nitrate it is going to dissolve in water so that's a nice rule not really in any exceptions to speak of all nitrates are soluble and we can say the same thing about compounds that have Alkali metal ions that would be things like lithium sodium potassium rubidium and cesium ions and the ammonium ion those are always going to be soluble as well and so if you take a look at any compound if it has an Alkali metal Ion on the front of it or an ammonium it will dissolve in water once again not really any uh exceptions to that rule as far as I can tell as far as I know anyway and so those are a couple of excellent rules in fact you can probably get through most if not all of AP Chemistry by just knowing those two rules those solubility rules they write the AP exam in such a way that you don't really have to know the others but if you're serious about learning chemistry you really do need to know the other solubility rules as well because if you're planning on going into chemistry and you don't know these solubility rules they're going to maybe laugh you out of the classroom I don't know but you need to know some of the others like acetates are soluble compounds that end with that acetate ion you see anything at all even lead or Mercury but it's acetate it is going to dissolve in water so those are some nice rules there here's another one uh the nice thing about those first three rules is is that as far as I know there are no exceptions these upcoming rules here do have some exceptions all chlorides all bromides and all iodides are soluble in water and there are some exceptions to that silver lead and Mercury so if you see silver chloride that's that's an exception that's not going to dissolve in water or lead to iodide once again that's not going to dissolve in water but but pretty much every other chloride bromide or iodide that you could come up with those are for the most part going to dissolve in water sulfates are also soluble almost all the time notice that there are six sulfates that are not soluble they are silver sulfate lead sulfate Mercury one sulfate calcium sulfate strontium sulfate and barium sulfate so once again three of your six exceptions are the same exceptions that you had up here silver lead and Mercury so those it seems like those silver leaded Mercury compounds for some reason don't dissolve in water quite as well as the others notice that the other three calcium strontium and barium those are your heavier group two elements and so maybe you can remember those as you look at your periodic table on the left side there toward group two kind of toward the bottom those are some of your exceptions those are your your insoluble sulfates that you have to know now these next few rules are for substances that generally speaking don't dissolve in water like chromates generally speaking chromates do not dissolve in water unless of course they happen to be alkali metals and ammonium chromates because those those ions always dissolve in water but other chromates are not going to dissolve in water phosphates are the same way phosphates generally speaking do not dissolve in water unless of course you have alkaline metals or ammonium on the front of it same thing with carbonates carbonates don't dissolve in water either unless you have those alkali metals or ammonium on the front of there so chromates phosphates carbonates generally speaking do not dissolve in water and then here's another one that's quite important to know hydroxides usually hydroxides do not dissolve in water and the only exceptions are group one and your heavier group two so your Alkali metal hydroxides of course on the left side of the table and then your heavier group two hydroxides like barium strontium and calcium and you might remember from an earlier lesson I believe that was in an earlier unit we said that those hydroxides in fact those are there are basically only eight hydroxides that are are soluble if you look at the exceptions there those are your strong bases and so the strong bases are essentially the same as your soluble hydroxide so that's kind of an interesting rule there to go along with solubility now like I said before it's important to know these because this is going to help us to write net ionic equations as we move into the next video here in this next part of section two but let's just do some practice here which of these compounds are soluble in water so let's start with the sodium per bromate now hopefully your eyes kind of kind of move over toward the sodium and you realize that since there's an Alkali metal ion there that has to be soluble in water so yes that is going to dissolve and how do we know oh there's a sodium right there all alkaline metal ions and those compounds are going to dissolve how about the barium phosphate once again your eyes hopefully will gravitate toward the phosphate and you'll see that yeah you know for the most part phosphates do not dissolve in water so that one is insoluble about the Iron III chromate once again you might remember the rule for chromates and we said chromates generally speaking are not soluble so those do not dissolve in water how about gold three chloride well chlorides do dissolve in water don't they now there are only three exceptions to that rule silver lead and mercury and this is not one of those three so gold three chloride is soluble in water next we have a barium nitrate well the very first rule we saw was that all nitrates are soluble so yes barium nitrate is going to dissolve in water Mercury one sulfate now we said that sulfates generally were soluble but this was one of those six exceptions wasn't it so yeah that one's not going to dissolve in water at all what about aluminum bromide well our eyes once again should gravitate toward the bromide we said that all bromides are soluble right except for silver lead and mercury and this is not one of those exceptions so this is certainly going to dissolve into and so we have some practice there now you know I I'll be wondering why should we care about this why is it important to know the solubility rules well as we write these net ionic equations in the next couple of videos you're going to find that soluble ionic compounds exist as separate ions in water solution that means that those ions are going to dissociate and so you'll have separate ions swimming around in the water solution in order to make a reaction on the other hand insoluble compounds those those don't dissolve that means they do not dissociate they just sink down to the bottom of the beaker and they exist as complete compounds in water solution so what that means is if you have something like sodium nitrate this is a soluble compound isn't it it's going to dissolve in water all nitrates are soluble and that Alkali metal tells us that too so that means that since it's soluble it's going to die associate into its ions and in solution you're going to have sodium ions and nitrate ions swimming around in solution likewise if you have copper II sulfate well that's soluble because most sulfates are soluble aren't they they're going to dissolve that means that when you take this substance and dissolve it in water what you're going to have will be copper ions swimming around in solution and sulfate ions swimming around in solution that way you know those will be available for perhaps a chemical reaction now if you have this compound right here silver chloride this is not soluble is it you know most chlorides are soluble but this is one of those three exceptions so guess what it's not going to dissolve it's not going to dissociate it just sinks down to the bottom of the beaker and remains as agcl silver chloride solid it is insoluble so I hope you have learned here about the solubility rules hope you enjoyed this video if you got something out of this please smash that thumbs up button and keep watching because in our next couple of videos we're going to find some applications here and we're going to see how we can write knit ionic equations using these solubility rules I'm Jeremy Krug thanks for watching,"4,534",0,36
"Writing Net Ionic Equations - AP Chemistry Unit 4, Topic 2b","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to write net ionic equations, working several examples throughout the video.  He also shows how gas evolution reactions can be solved as a part of net ionic reactions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5QDMQIOpmI&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=37,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're moving on with unit 4 section 2 as we continue to talk more about net ionic equations in our last video we learned about how to determine the solubility rules and to determine if something is soluble or not in solution in this video we're going to apply those rules so let's try an example here let's see what happens when Solutions of barium nitrate and sodium sulfate are mixed vigorously well the first thing that you want to do is isolate your reactants and write them in ionic form if possible so in this first one we have the barium nitrate and we know that nitrates are solubles we need to write that in its ion form so that would be barium two plus and nitrate ions now next we have sodium sulfate so that's also soluble and we know that because it says that there's a solution of that as well so is it soluble yes so we have to write these in its ion form so that would be sodium in a plus and sulfate is so4 to negative now once you write these reactants in ion form you need to realize that the ions are going to try to swap Partners so that means that this barium over here is going to try to pair up with the other negative ion and likewise this sodium is going to try to pair up with the other compounds negative ion they're going to try to swap out now we have to ask ourselves which of those combinations is going to produce an insoluble compound now in order to answer this we have to know our solubility rules and if you remember the solubility rules from last video you might remember hopefully that barium sulfate is the combination that's going to be insoluble so yes you need to know those solubility rules now these other ions that don't do anything we call those spectator ions because essentially well they're Spectators they're just sitting there they're not doing anything they aren't actually participating in the game as it were they aren't participating in the chemical reaction so what's going to happen is the barium two plus ions are going to react with the sulfate so42 negative ions and when they get together they're going to make barium sulfate and so this is how you would write the overall equation for this process now when you write this this is something called the net ionic equation and the net ionic equation essentially omits these spectator ions those ions that really aren't doing anything in the reaction let's try another example let's try a chemist takes a flask of potassium chloride and adds a few drops of silver nitrate solution so once again we start with the first one potassium chloride that's soluble so we have to write it in its ion form so that would be K plus and cl negative and then we have silver nitrate solution of course that's in solution so it's soluble so silver nitrate would be AG plus and then nitrate is NO3 negative and just like last time those ions are going to try to swap Partners the outsides are going to get together or try to get together in the insides we'll try to get together so once again we have to ask ourselves which of those insoluble compound and once again you have to think back to your solubility rules ornate nitrates are soluble but silver chloride is not soluble is it so you have to know that this is the combination that's actually going to make the insoluble precipitate the product so that means that these other two your potassium ion and your nitrate ions those are called spectator ions aren't they so we have to take the AG Plus and a CL negative and those will combine to make agcl solid so that's how you'd write the net ionic equation for that process let's try another example Solutions of calcium nitrate and zinc chloride are mixed in a beaker once again the same process calcium nitrate well soluble all nitrates are soluble so that would be calcium ion ca2 plus and NO3 negative just like that and then we have zinc chloride once again that's soluble so it's zinc two plus and chloride negative and just like we did before these ions are going to try to swap out and we have to ask ourselves which of these is going to make the insoluble precipitate and you might be thinking well hang on here all nitrates are soluble so it's not that one and chlorides are soluble too aren't they and this is not an exception so it actually looks like none of these will make the insoluble precipitate and that's correct as it turns out there is no precipitate formed and all of these are actually spectator ions the calcium the nitrate the zinc and the chloride and so when that happens when the nothing's going to react well it's no reaction and that does happen sometimes where you add two solutions and you look in the beaker or look in the flask and nothing happens it's a no reaction now just so you know generally speaking on the AP Chemistry exam they're not going to give you too many of these no reactions there's going to be something that reacts for the most part but just be aware that in the real world in the laboratory yeah you can mix Solutions and nothing happens that is not unusual let's try another one Solutions of potassium phosphate and lead to nitrate are allowed to react in a test tube so same deal here we're going to take the potassium phosphate and that's a solution so it's K plus and phosphate is po4 three negative and we're going to add lead to nitrate to that so that would be PB two plus and then NO3 negative and the same thing the ions are going to swap out here here and we have to ask ourselves which of these two combinations is going to make the and hopefully you remember the rule from the last video that phosphates are generally insoluble aren't they so it's going to be the lead to phosphate and that means that your potassium and your nitrate those don't make a solid so those are going to be the spectator ions and so I'm going to write them over here just in their ion form and we're going to make this lead to phosphate so when you write the net ionic equation we have pb2 Plus po4 3 negative the phosphate will yield lead to phosphate so there's our knit ionic equation one little detail that you want to take care of though notice this is not a balanced equation you want to balance that equation so we have three lead atoms and and two phosphate ions on both sides of the arrow so that's generally speaking how we write net ionic equations now we could stop there and say that's it but the fact is there are a couple other things you need to know about there are some details there are a few compounds that sometimes you'll encounter in these equations in these products that don't actually exist there are three special cases where that's the case and these are substances that do not exist at normal temperatures and pressures they just really don't exist and so instead of being produced they're going to undergo what's called a gas Evolution reaction now the first one carbonic acid is one that we've talked about a little bit in unit three carbonic acid will basically spontaneously turn into water and carbon dioxide and so this is essentially carbonated water is what you have here now sulfurous acid h2so3 undergoes something similar except it's going to produce water and sulfur dioxide gas so that's the gas Evolution reaction for that one and ammonium hydroxide doesn't really exist either at normal temperatures and pressures it's going to do something water and ammonia gas you need to know those three and what they produce let's try a couple of examples with these the first one is one that you've probably seen before solid baking soda sodium bicarbonate is poured into a beaker containing a solution of vinegar dilute acetic acid you may have done this reaction in elementary school and you've probably seen what happens when you mix baking soda and vinegar well let's take a look at this here so the solid baking soda is sodium bicarbonate now notice that this is not in solution so we don't ionize it ionic compounds are only ionized when they're dissolved in water so since this is not dissolved we just have to write it as nahco3 now the vinegar that acetic acid is a weak acid and you might remember from you know back in unit 3 weak acids are not ionized to any appreciable amount so we just write it as its formula H c2h3o2 and once again we're going to try the same thing we're going to try to swap these ions out here and think which of these two is going to make something well if you take the H and add it with hco3 you're going to have something you'll have H2 CO3 these others you know sodium and acetate and that's going to be soluble in that solution so those are going to be ionized now one thing that we hopefully remember is that h2co3 doesn't really exist in this reaction we should probably cross that out and replace it with water and carbon dioxide gas and if you look at this equation and the way it's written there really aren't any spectator ions everything is doing something and so we're going to write it pretty much like this the nahco3 solid which is the baking soda is going to react with the vinegar that's the H c2h3o2 aqueous and we're going to make liquid water and carbon dioxide gas you'll see that in the form of bubbles probably quite vigorously bubbling and then you'll have sodium ions aqueous and acetate ions aqueous as well so that's the equation for what's going on when you mix baking soda and vinegar let's try one more example here with a gas Evolution reaction and in this example we're going to take a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution and add it to a beaker containing aqueous ammonium chloride so we'll start with the sodium hydroxide up here and that's a strong base and it is certainly going to dissociate all the way so we have sodium ions and we have hydroxide ions and then ammonium chloride anything that starts with ammonium is of course going to be soluble isn't so we have nh4 plus and we have CL negative so once again we're trying to swap these ions and we should try to imagine what's actually going to make something here well it's not the sodium and chloride is it because that's soluble but ammonium and hydroxide tend to do something don't they we would think that they'd be ammonium hydroxide right of course sodium and chloride are spectator ions but we also know that ammonium hydroxide is not really going to exist is it in this equation it's going to be ammonia and water in H3 and H2O so we actually do have a couple spectator ions here we have the sodium and the chloride are The Spectator ions so what's left is going to be the nh4 plus which is our ammonium ion aqueous and our hydroxide ions aqueous will produce water in its liquid state and ammonia gas and H3 and so if you mix this you're probably going to smell that ammonia gas it's probably going to have a fairly strong odor to it which is another sign of a chemical reaction I hope you learned about how to write net ionic equations if you did please slam that thumbs up button and leave a comment down below if you'd like that really does help the algorithm I'm Jeremy Kroger I've been teaching apicometry for something like 24 years and I hope you are able to learn AP Chemistry with these videos join me in my next video and we're going to be learning about other types of reactions some of which are not in solution thanks for watching,"4,515",0,37
"Predicting Products of Reactions - AP Chem Unit 4, Topic 2c","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to predict products of various synthesis and decomposition reactions, working several examples throughout the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhH15-vkgeY&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=38,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we're moving on with AP Chemistry unit 4 section 2 and the last part of that where we're learning about other types of reactions now a lot of these you just have to learn and have to know the the specific uh ways in which these substances have react and so this takes a little bit of time to to practice on that for example you need to know that a metallic oxide is going to combine with water to produce a metallic hydroxide so that means that if you have a case where you're adding solid potassium oxide to water well you have to know how to write the formulas for this of course potassium oxide is k2o solid and then of course water is H2O and our product is going to be a metallic hydroxide so hydroxide means it ends with oh of course and the metallic part of that means that the metal which is the potassium in this case is going to be your cation on your product so the metallic hydroxide is potassium hydroxide now notice how I write this I have to write it in ion form because since water is present that means we're going to have a solution that is going to be there so these these ions are going to be swimming around in Solutions we have potassium ions and hydroxide ions that's your potassium hydroxide now don't forget to balance the equation so we put a a 2 in front of the K and I believe a 2 in front of the o h and that's going to balance this equation pretty well now the next one the next example here is very similar this time we're adding solid strontium oxide to water the same type of reaction essentially except we're essentially just substituting the strontium in place of where the potassium was in the last example so strontium oxide is SRO and then water is H2O of course and so once again the product of this metallic oxide being added to water is going to be the metallic hydroxide in this case that strontium ions and hydroxide ions and of course don't forget to balance that equation so that's one type of synthesis reaction that you need to be aware of here's another one a non-metallic oxide is going to combine with water to produce an acid so like we said metallic oxides tend to produce bases you know hydroxides non-metallic oxides tend to produce acids and so in this case here if we have sulfur trioxide gas that's bubbled into water well sulfur trioxide is SO3 we add that to water so the overall product seems to be looks like if you add these up it would be h2so4 which is sulfuric acid and that's correct but we have to remember that this is a strong acid so it's going to be written in its ionized form which is h plus aqueous and then the hydrogen sulfate ion which has a negative charge so once again you do have to be aware of which acids are strong and which acids are weak which we learned in back in unit 3. now how about this one solid diphosphorus pentoxide reacts violently with water so you have to know that diphosphorus pentoxide is p2o5 and we're adding it to water and what's the product well sometimes you just have to know what the product is and if we think of an acid that has of course hydrogen and phosphorus and oxygen in it probably the most common example would be phosphoric acid h3po4 and it's it's kind of difficult to to get that from just looking at the reactants and adding up the subscripts you honestly aren't going to get that sometimes you just have to know which acid is formed either way you do need to balance the equation so we can do that by balancing our different atoms there and we have a balanced equation so what's another type of reaction well we know that there are decomposition Reactions where you have what reactant and that reactant is going to literally well decompose that's why it's called decomposition so you have one reactant and it decomposes into two or sometimes more than two products so there are several of these that you need to be aware of a metallic carbonate when heated vigorously will often decompose into a metallic oxide and carbon dioxide gas so a good example of that is solid calcium carbonate is heated over a flame in a crucible so calcium carbonate of course is CaCO3 and when it's heated we're going to get that carbon dioxide gas that's mentioned here but we're going to have a metallic oxide and the the metal in the metallic oxide is the calcium so we're going to have calcium oxide along with carbon dioxide gas and so using that rule you can figure out what the products are or likewise if we have instead of calcium carbonate if we have lithium carbonate and it's heated vigorously well we can take the lithium carbonate right its formula in the solid form it's li2co3 and once again we're going to get carbon dioxide gas but this time it's going to be lithium oxide so those are the products for this one and of course make sure that the equation is balanced and looks like in this case it it already is now what about chlorates sometimes we have questions about metallic chlorates when those are heated vigorously they're going to produce a metallic chloride and oxygen gas so in this case if we have solid sodium chlorate in a test tube that's heated vigorously well we know that sodium chlorate is naclo3 and when we heat it vigorously we're going to get oxygen gas O2 and the metallic chloride is going to be sodium chloride so these are our products now notice that we don't write sodium chloride in its ion form and the reason is there is no water present here if this had been perhaps aqueous or if there had been water present or if we had added water then you'd have to ionize this but there there is no water so it's going to be sodium chloride solid and once again don't forget to balance the equation we can balance our oxygens there and then the sodium and the chloride ions as well How about if solid calcium chlorate is heated vigorously once again it is the same type of reaction here we write the formula for calcium chlorate CA parentheses clo3 and then a two and we're going to make this time it's going to be calcium chloride and oxygen gas the equation there as well so we have our our balanced equation for these also you need to be aware that acids can decompose into non-metallic oxides along with water and bases are going to decompose into metallic oxides and water when they're heated so this is basically the opposite of the rule that we had earlier with synthesis we have for example if we have carbonic acid that's decomposing at normal atmospheric pressures well we write the formula for Carbonic acid h2co3 and we know that we're going to have a non-metallic oxide produced from that so that's carbon dioxide and water so this is a fairly simple reaction in fact this probably looks familiar if you were watching the last video about gas Evolution reactions what about this if we have solid sodium hydroxide being heated in a test tube once again we have n a o h in its solid form and if we heat it well it's a base so we're going to have a metallic oxide so that's going to be sodium oxide along with water so na2o and H2O and of course don't forget to balance your equation whenever you write these more often than not these are rules that you just have to learn you just have to know them I hope you've learned something from this if you have please slam that thumbs up button I would appreciate it if you would do that that really helps the algorithm I'm Jeremy Krug I've been teaching AP Chemistry for 24 years and I hope to

"Visually Representing Reactions / Physical vs Chemical Changes - AP Chem Unit 4, Topics 3-4","In this video, Mr. Krug covers Topics 3 and 4 of AP Chemistry Unit 4.  Topic 3 shows how to visually represent chemical reactions using a graphical representation.  Topic 4 shows how the line can sometimes be blurred between chemical and physical changes. 0:00  Topic 4.3 4:02  Topic 4.4",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lzI1vO118g&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=39,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we're moving on in AP Chemistry with a video that covers two fairly short yet rather important sections here in AP Chemistry sections 4.3 and 4.4 now unit 4 section 3 is about how we can portray chemical reactions in a graphical form or in a pictorial form so we're going to try an example here and this is a fairly typical question that they might ask you on an exam like an AP exam or something like that where we have a balanced equation we have 2 no plus O2 yields 2 NO2 and we're given a a blank box to fill in to show what the reactant mixture would have looked like and then we're given a a box that has the product mixture here at the end of the reaction it gives us kind of a legend here at the bottom it shows us that the oxygen atom are the white circles and the nitrogen atom are represented by the the gray circles we have to remember that when you have a balanced equation those coefficients represent a recipe for producing the appropriate numbers of molecules or ions or atoms or whatever you're trying to make in the reaction so what you want to do here is first of all count up how many atoms you're working with so as I count up the atoms I see that there are there seem to be eight nitrogen atoms those are the ones in Gray and I believe I'm counting up 12 oxygen atoms which are the white circles now another thing I want to notice is that in the product mixture that you have here at the end notice that the product is nitrogen dioxide but you actually have a couple of nitrogen monoxide molecules that never reacted and so those are basically molecules that were left over here in our upcoming video we'll call that an excess reactant so these molecules never really did anything so I'm just going to take those four n o molecules and I'm just going to pop those over here into the reactant box because they they were actually there starting out they never did anything so that takes care of four nitrogens and four oxygens and so now I'm down to four nitrogens and eight oxygens that I have to work with and those are the atoms that I'm going to use to work backwards and to create my molecules of the reactants and so the recipe here tells me that for every two molecules of nitrogen monoxide I'm going to have one molecule of oxygen O2 so I'm going to do that once and so I'm going to draw two no's and one O2 kind of like this over here and that means that I'm down to two nitrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms left so I can do that again and draw two more nitrogen monoxide molecules and one oxygen molecule and it looks like this and now I've used up all my atoms so if you're asked to do this and sometimes it could be in the opposite direction from reactants to products just make sure that you have the same number of atoms for each element on both sides of the arrow so you know I had eight nitrogen atoms 12 oxygen atoms we can't destroy atoms we have to have the same numbers of nitrogens and oxygens you know for each side there we can't change one element into another and so you can't somehow magically take an oxygen a white circle and turn it into a gray Circle it doesn't work that way you have to have eight nitrogens 12 oxygens on both sides also have to respect the recipe here that that ratio of two no's to one O2 so that's how you would would solve something like this now we're going to move right on into section four of unit four and this is about chemical changes in physical changes so earlier in unit 4 section one we took a look at how certain things are physical changes like melting or tearing something up or breaking it as opposed to chemical changes which are things like burning and rusting and oxidizing and things like that but what if I give you this if I say solid salt is dissolved in water is that a chemical change or is that a physical change now if you give this question to a student who's just starting out in first year chemistry or maybe into maybe a a middle school science class the student and even the teacher might say well that sure looks like a physical change because you're just dissolving something you still have salt you still have water but is it completely a physical change well think about it in this in this way we know as we've learned in this course already back in unit two and the unit 3 as well that if you have an ionic compound like sodium chloride and you dissolve it in water ionic bonds are actually being broken and so chemical bonds are actually being broken in this process in fact the only way that an ionic compound can dissolve into water is if the ion dipole forces between water and the ions are stronger than the ionic bonds that hold that formula unit or that that Crystal together so yeah bonds are actually being broken here we know that ion dipole forces are forming and they are quite strong like we said and the structure of that ionic crystal lattice is being broken and ions are certainly being rearranged and so this particular process actually has some characteristics of a chemical process as well and so if we were to just dogmatically say well this is a physical change but we're ignoring some very important chemistry that's actually going on when an ionic compound is being dissolved and so the point of this statement here is that sometimes the line between a physical change and a chemical reaction is not as obvious As It Seems sometimes it's a little blurry or this this particular process and anytime you have an ionic compound dissolved into water you have that that that blurriness there there are some characteristics of a physical change but it certainly has characteristics of a chemical reaction as well and so it's not as obvious as it might seem so this is something that you do need to be aware of as you're thinking about the difference between a a physical change and a chemical reaction I hope you learned something from this rather short video over these two uh rather short but important sections if you learn something please hit that thumbs up button I I do appreciate it hope you join me in a very important and much longer section in unit 4 section 5 which is going to cover reaction stoichiometry,"2,279",0,39
"Reaction Stoichiometry Made Easy - AP Chemistry Unit 4, Topic 5a","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students a simple three-step process for working reaction stoichiometry problems.  He works several examples throughout the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZHDvyv_z0c&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=40,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and we are moving into unit 4 section 5 of AP Chemistry which is about reaction Stoichiometry now of all the sections and topics that AP Chemistry covers there are some sections that are very short that can be covered in just a couple of minutes however this is one of those sections that's going to take several videos to get through because reaction Stoichiometry is a very important topic in in all of chemistry to be honest and so we're going to start in this first video about the basics and the fundamentals of carrying out a reaction Stoichiometry problem now when we carry out one of these problems and we're converting quantities of substances in a reaction there are three steps that you want to to keep in mind the first step is convert to moles now if you've forgotten how to do this or never learned how to do this very well you can go all the way back to unit one section one where we first started talking about how to convert to moles now once you do that the second part of this is the mole ratio now we've learned about mole ratios before but in this part or in this section when we talk about a balanced equation the numbers for the mole ratio are going to be derived directly from the coefficients of the balanced equation we're going to see several examples of that now the third step is convert to final unit usually the problem asks us to to find a value that's not moles and so it perhaps it's grams or molecules or atoms in that case we have to convert in this third step and convert to that final unit whatever it might be if the final unit that we are being asked for is moles and I guess we don't have to do this third step but most the time we are going to have to do that this is what I call our three-step process for reactions Stoichiometry so we're going to do a couple examples here and see how this works so in this first problem copper reacts with nitric acid to create the brown toxic gas nitrogen dioxide and there's the equation for that if a chemist desires to produce 1.00 grams of nitrogen dioxide gas what mass of copper metal should be dropped into excess nitric acid well the first thing that you want to do is balance the equation this only works if we have a balanced chemical equation so we can balance the equation and now we're able to actually work the problem so notice that the question says we're trying to produce 1.00 grams of nitrogen dioxide so I'm going to write that down that's what we're we're starting with in our problem and the question is asking us to determine the mass of copper metal so that's grams of copper so way down here at the end I'm trying to convert to grams of copper now we're going to go through our three-step process Step One is convert to moles so whenever we're converting from grams to moles we start by putting grams on the bottom because that's the unit that we're trying to get rid of and since we're converting to moles moles need to go on the top so one mole on top how many grams are in one mole of nitrogen dioxide well use the periodic table add up those individual atomic masses nitrogen is about 14 and each oxygen is about 16 so that adds up to about 46.01 grams in a mole of that compound we can cancel grams top and bottom and now we are ready for step two which is the mole ratio now like I said instead of having units in this mole ratio we're going to use substances from the equation so since we're starting with NO2 I'm going to put NO2 on the bottom that way it'll cancel out out and since I'm trying to convert to Copper I'm going to put copper on the top now remember the numbers for the mole ratio are coming straight from the balanced equation the coefficient so next to copper in the balanced equation there's nothing there so that's understood to be a one so I'll put a 1 right here next to NO2 there's a coefficient of 2. so I put a 2 right there this is a 1 to 2 ratio NO2 cancels out top and bottom and now I'm in moles of copper but I want to be in grams of copper so that's why I have to do step three which is convert to final unit and the final unit I'm converting to is grams so in my last step I have to put the one mole on the bottom so moles will cancel and grams on top how many grams are in one mole of copper well we once again look at the periodic table the atomic mass of copper is 63.55 grams in one mole so I can cancel moles and now I can do the mathematics on my calculator I just take 1.00 divided by 46.01 divided by 2 times 63.55 and when I get the answer it is 0.691 grams of copper so that's how you solve these problems let's try another one this one it says potassium like all the alkali metals explodes violently when dropped into water creating a metallic hydroxide and hydrogen gas and there's the equation a 2.35 gram sample of potassium metal is added to excess water how many moles of hydrogen gas are expected to be produced so once again the very first thing we have to do is balance that equation because this only works if you have a balanced equation so if I do this now I have my balanced equation so once again I'm starting with 2.35 grams of potassium so I write that down and the question asks how many moles of hydrogen gas so this time at the end I'm trying to solve for moles of hydrogen gas H2 so let's go through our Three Steps step one is convert to moles so I have to put grams on the bottom and one mole goes on the top since I'm converting to moles now how many grams are in a mole of potassium well look at the periodic table it's about 39.10 that's the atomic mass of potassium so now I can cancel grams and I'm in moles of potassium step two is the mole ratio so my mole ratio I'm going to put K you know potassium on the bottom so it'll cancel and since I'm converting to H2 H2 has to go in the numerator and the numbers for this mole ratio are drawn straight out of the balanced equation so there's a one next to H2 so I'll put a 1 there and there's a 2 next to potassium so I'll put a 2 for that one this is a one to two ratio so cancel that out top and bottom I'm in moles of hydrogen and guess what my goal is to be in moles of hydrogen so I don't even have to do a third step this time I'm already in that final unit so now I just have to key these numbers into my calculator I take 2.35 divided by 39.10 divided by 2 and I get the answer as .0301 moles of hydrogen I hope this video has helped you to to solve some simple reactions toichiometry problems if this video has helped you if you've enjoyed this learn something from it please smash that like button and leave a comment down below if you'd be so kind as to do so that really helps the algorithm my name is Jeremy Krug I've been teaching AP Chemistry for 24 years something like that in our next video we're going to take a look at some other methods here and how we can take a look at problems called limiting reactant problems and percent yield hope to see you on that video thanks for watching,"3,461",0,40
"Stoichiometry Problems - Limiting Reactant & Percent Yield - AP Chem Unit 4, Topic 5b","In this video, Mr. Krug continues Unit 4, Section 5 by discussing some more advanced types of reaction stoichiometry problems, specifically limiting reactant problems and percent yield problems.  He works several problems throughout this video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7mKXr7LZ3I&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=41,hi there I'm Jeremy Crush let's imagine that instead of carrying out a chemical reaction that instead we're making grilled cheese sandwiches now if you're trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich this is generally speaking the recipe or the equation that you would use to make that sandwich you'd have two slices of bread and one slice of cheese and when you put those together you're going to make one grilled cheese sandwich so that's the the ratio or the equation for carrying out this process now let's imagine that you're trying to make sandwiches if you start with 50 slices of bread and 50 slices of cheese how many sandwiches can we make well those of you who've had some experience with this know that you aren't going to make 50 sandwiches are you you're only going to make 25 sandwiches and why is that the case well even though we do have enough slices of cheese to make 50 sandwiches since you have to have two slices of bread to make a sandwich we only have enough bread to make half that many or 25 sandwiches and so since we are going to carry out this process and use the bread and the cheese if you start carrying out this process you find that you run out of bread and since you run out of bread first we would call that our limiting reactant so in in chemistry whenever you have two or more reactants that you're trying to react the one that runs out first is called the limiting reactant that's the one that basically causes the process to to stop for all practical purposes now after you've made your 25 sandwiches you're going to have a bunch of cheese left over well since you have excess cheese we call that the excess reactant so once again the reactant that's consumed first or the one that produces less product we call that the limiting reactant and then the reactant that's left over at the end of the process that's called the excess reactant so we're going to do a couple problems here where we're looking at the fact that there are two reactants and one of them is going to run out first that's the limiting reactant so what we're going to start with here is a problem here we have lithium metal and sulfur flowers that can be reacted to produced lithium sulfide in there we have the bowel or the equation for that if 0.906 grams of lithium are reacted with 2.79 grams of sulfur how many grams of lithium sulfide can we expect to produce which of the reactants is the limiting reactant and which one is the excess reactant so as we always have to do in a reaction Stoichiometry problem we have to balance the equation first so there we go now we have a balanced equation and what we have to recognize is in this problem we actually have two quantities given to us these are both quantities of reactants so we have to write down both of those we're going to take the point 906 grams of lithium and write that down right along with the 2.79 grams of sulfur now the question is asking how many grams of lithium sulfide can we produce so at the end here I'm going to put lithium sulfide grams of lithium sulfide and what we're going to do is go through our three-step process both times and we're going to figure out how many grams of lithium sulfide we could get based on each of these reactant quantities and then we'll have two answers well the answer that's correct is going to be the smaller of those two answers because the limiting reactant is the one that controls how much product you make and that's the one that produces the least amount of product so we're going to start with the 0.906 grams of lithium our first step just like it always is in a reaction Stoichiometry problem is to convert to moles so I'm going to have to put grams on the bottom and one mole of one mole on top and how many grams are in one mole of lithium well the periodic table here tells us it's 6.94 so I'm going to use that that's its atomic mass so grams are out and now we're in moles of lithium step two is the mole ratio so I'm going to have to put lithium on the bottom and lithium sulfide on the top and for the mole ratio I have to refer to the ballast equation to get the numbers this is an 8 to 16 mole ratio based on the coefficients of those substances so 8 to 16 lithium is out now I'm in moles of lithium sulfide I want to be in grams of lithium sulfide so in my last step I'm going to put one mole on bottom and grams on top so I can convert to that final unit of grams and how many grams are in a mole lithium sulfide well add up those atomic masses on the periodic table its molar mass is about 45.94 grams in one mole so now I can cancel moles top and bottom and on my calculator I take 0.906 divided by 6.94 times 8 divide by 16 times 45.94 and the answer I'm getting is about 3.00 grams of lithium sulfide now I have to do this process again to get the smaller of the two answers here so let's try the next one so once again I have to convert to moles as my first step so grams on bottom one mole on top and according to the periodic table how many grams are in one mole of S8 well that would be about 256.48 grams in a mole so I can cancel grams and go on to step two which is the mole ratio so S8 is the substance that goes on the bottom I'm converting to lithium sulfide so that goes on the top and looking at the coefficients this seems to be an 8 to 1 mole ratio so eight to one goes into that mole ratio S8 will cancel and I want to convert to grams so I have to do that last step here so one mole on the bottom and the grams on top and once again the number of grams in one mole of lithium sulfide is 45.94 so now I can cancel moles and do the math here take the 2.79 divide by 256.48 times 8 times 45.94 and my answer is 4.00 grams now we have two answers here which one is the correct one well it's the smaller one isn't it so the answer is 3.00 grams of lithium sulfide so that's the answer now which of the reactants is the limiting reactant well it's the reactant that produces the smaller amount so that means that the lithium since that produced the smaller amount the lithium is going to run out first that's the limiting reactant now which one is the excess reactant that's asked all as well on the problem well it's the other one it's the one that doesn't run out first so that would be the sulfur in this case S8 would be our excess reactant so that's how you solve a limiting reactant problem you have to do the three-step Stoichiometry process twice and then select the smaller of the two answers that you get now one of the question went a step further and said okay in the previous problem how much of the excess reactant was left unreacted so that's an important problem to be able to do now if we flip back to the problem that we just looked at you'll see that the limiting reactant was lithium that means that in the problem we actually used up all 0.906 grams of that lithium so what I can do is I can take that 0.906 grams of lithium and I can carry out another Stoichiometry process to find out how many grams of the sulfur we actually used so this is how much we actually used we're going to figure out how many grams of the sulfur we used as well so that requires another Stoichiometry process so I'm going to take grams and put that on the bottom and one mole on top so I can convert to moles and once again the atomic mass of lithium is 6.94 so that's how many grams are in a mole of that grams are out now I can do my mole ratio so lithium on the bottom sulfur on the top and this is a 1 to 16 mole ratio according to the coefficients so lithium is out I'm in moles of sulfur so I want to convert to grams of sulfur so one mole on the bottom grams on top and if I add that up on the periodic table it's about 256.48 grams in one mole of sulfur so now I can cancel moles and when I do the math on here 0.906 divided by 6.94 divided by 16 times 256.48 I find that I'm actually going to use 2.09 grams of sulfur now in the last problem it said that I had 2.79 grams available to me and if I use 2.09 grams all I have to do is subtract and I can figure out how much is left over it's like if I have 10 apples and I eat three of them how many are left well I just have to subtract it's the same thing here when I subtract the amount I started with minus the amount I used up I find that I'm left over with .70 grams of sulfur so that's how much of the excess reactant is left over so those are limiting reactant problems now we're going to take another look at how we we think about reactions Stoichiometry and take a look at the concept of percent yield now in a in a typical experiment in the laboratory we make a lot of assumptions we're assuming that all of the reactants will actually react and make product in the real world that actually doesn't happen very often there might be a reason why a reactant doesn't react and we actually have a less than 100 percent yield and so this calculation here helps us to figure out what the percent yield is it's actual yield and that's how much we actually produce in a reaction we have to to normally determine that experimentally the theoretical yield goes in the denominator and the theoretical yield is the amount of product that we calculate that should be produced in a reaction and that's normally determined using a Stoichiometry problem so the problems that we've just been working in this last example or in the previous video we've been calculating theoretical yields in pretty much all of those now we're going to solve and calculate some percent yield values here so let's say that in an experiment a chemist calculates that 16.37 grams of calcium carbonate should be produced however after the experiment is complete only 14.08 grams are actually collected what is the percent yield of this process well it's fairly simple we just use that same equation that we looked at we're solving for the percent yield the actual yield is which of these numbers well it's 14.08 grams that's how much we actually collected the theoretical yield is how much we calculate that should be produced the 16.37 grams so when we divide this and then multiply by 100 we find that the percent yield is 86.01 so that's a fairly straightforward process there now what if we have another type of question let's say that we have a certain experimental process that is known to have a 72.0 percent yield in order to produce 10.0 grams of the product in the laboratory the chemist should strive to produce what theoretical yield during the process so this is an interesting question if you kind of know what the percent yield is before you even go into the lab you can actually adjust your your your values and get 10 grams so let's once again plug this into the equation this time we know what the percent yield is we know that it's a 72.0 percent yield now this time it says that the actual yield what we're actually trying to make is the 10.0 gram so that goes in the numerator and we're trying to determine what our theoretical yield should be so we're going to leave that as an X and we just have an algebra problem here so now I can divide both sides by 100 and cross multiply and if I divide both sides by 0.72 I find that I should strive to get a theoretical yield of 13.9 grams so if you know the percent yield ahead of time you can actually work around that and get how much you you really want to get let's try one more example with percent yield this is a little bit different here here we have calcium hydroxide that is made by adding calcium metal to water as shown in this equation a student drops a 5.00 gram chunk of solid calcium metal into excess water after filtering and drying the product the student finds that 7.76 grams of calcium hydroxide have been recovered what was the percent yield in this experiment well once again the very first thing you want to do is balance that equation because this is not balanced so when I balance it now I'm able to start the problem now I might notice that I do have two values given to me here but one of these the 7.76 grams of calcium hydroxide it says it has been recovered so that phrasing there implies that that amount is an actual yield that's the actual yield of the calcium hydroxide that was made in this process does the problem tell me the theoretical yield does it tell me how much calcium hydroxide I was supposed to make well it doesn't all it tells me is I started with a 5.00 gram chunk of calcium so I'm going to have to go through my three-step Stoichiometry process and solve and find out the theoretical yield of calcium hydroxide so I've got to do some Stoichiometry here I have to start with 5.00 grams of calcium and go through my three-step process to find out how many grams of calcium hydroxide I should have made in this process so Step One is convert to moles so that means grams on the bottom and one mole on the top the periodic table tells me that the atomic mass of calcium is about 40.08 so that's the number of grams in a mole of that so grams are out step two is the mole ratio so calcium is what I'm starting with so that goes on the bottom I'm trying to solve for calcium hydroxide so that goes on the top and looking at the balanced equation this seems to be a one to one mole ratio so put some ones in there calcium goes out and now I want to convert to grams of calcium hydroxide so one mole needs to go on the bottom and grams on top and if I use my calculator I can add up you know the atomic masses and find that the molar mass of calcium hydroxide is about 74.10 so now I can take 5.00 divide by 40.08 and Times by 74.10 and I find that the theoretical yield is 9.24 grams of so now the problem gave me the actual yield which was 7.76 grams I just calculated the theoretical yield which was 9.24 grams and so just divide those out and multiply by 100 and I find that the percent yield is 84.0 percent so several different ways that we can solve these percent yield problems or I should say several different ways in which they can be worded and then of course we have those limiting reactant problems in there as well I hope this video has given you a nice practice for these Stoichiometry problems hope you've learned something if so smash that thumbs up button in the next video we're going to find another application of reaction Stoichiometry and take a look at solution Stoichiometry so hope you enjoyed the video and hope to see you on that next video as well,"3,405",0,41

Solutions Stoichiometry this is a part of AP Chemistry unit 4 section 5. so we're going to take a look at this today now often we carry out reactions in the laboratory in solution and so it's important to be able to know how to do this we're going to use the same three-step process that we learned in an earlier video where Step One is convert to moles step two is you use a mole ratio using the the coefficients of the balanced equation and the third step is to convert to our final unit which might be grams or something else the only real difference here is that at the beginning we're going to consider the volume of the solution in liters and when we do step one which is convert to moles we're going to use molarity as the conversion factor now I'll show you how this works it's actually quite simple but let's take a look at a first problem here it says a student tries to produce a precipitative barium sulfate using the following balanced equation that you see here if the student adds 50.0 milliliters to 0.100 molar barium nitrate solution to excess sodium sulfate solution what mass of barium sulfate solid should be produced so once again we're going to start with what's given to us so it's the barium nitrate and we start with liters so we should know that 50 milliliters is the same as 0.05 liters of barium nitrate so that's what I'm going to write down starting out and at the end of my Stoichiometry here my goal is to convert to grams Mass is measured in grams so grams of barium sulfate down here at the end now the St the first step is convert to moles and so in my first step I have to put liters on the bottom and since I'm converting to moles moles on top now like I said instead of using the periodic table and the molar mass this time I'm going to use the molarity so I look at the molarity of that barium nitrate and it's 0.100 that means it's 0.100 moles per one liter so I can I can actually use that as a conversion factor so I'm going to cancel liters and I'm now in moles of barium nitrate now step two is the mole ratio this is just the way it has been before in fact from this step on it's basically the same as any other Stoichiometry problem use the mole ratio so barium nitrate on the bottom and barium sulfate on the top and I have to use the coefficients of the balanced equation to put those numbers in here so barium sulfate is a one barium nitrate is a one this is a one to one ratio so barium nitrate is out now I have to convert from moles to grams so in my last step I have to put one mole on the bottom grams on the top and as always if it's how many grams in a mole we use the atomic mass we find the molar mass using the periodic table it's about 233.39 grams in one mole of barium sulfate so now I just have to cancel moles and calculate 0.05 times 0.1 times 233.39 and the answer I'm getting is about 1.17 grams of barium sulfate so that's how you solve these problems this is basically just an application of reaction Stoichiometry really the only difference is in that first step when you convert to moles you use the molarity as a conversion factor after the reaction is complete some ions will remain in solution rank the following ions in order from lowest to greatest concentration we have the barium ions sodium ions and sulfate ions well there are some clues that we can look at in the problem it tells us right up here that the sodium sulfate is excess so what that means is at the end of this reaction we're going to have quite a bit of sodium and sulfate left over which means that the lowest concentration in solution would be the barium and so that's going to be the lowest concentration now once we go higher than that we can see that of course sodium and sulfate are left over but a pretty good chunk of the sulfate is going to be going toward producing this barium sulfate precipitate so I'd say that we'd have a fairly low concentration of sulfate not as low as barium but it is still going to be fairly low and the highest is going to be sodium and the reason sodium is the highest is noticeable actually twofold notice that it's a two to one ratio here two sodiums in that compound but also sodium is always a spectator ion as we learned in an earlier video here in unit 4. and since sodium ions don't really react and form a precipitate you're going to have a whole lot of sodium ions swimming around in solution so that's that answer there let's try another problem in the reaction above a zinc phosphate precipitate is produced if a chemist adds 60.0 milliliters of 0.100 molar zinc chloride solution to 75.0 milliliters of 0.150 molar sodium phosphate solution what mass of zinc phosphate solid should be produced so you might notice that this time we actually have two quantities of reactants given to us we have it tells us how much zinc chloride and how much sodium phosphate so this sounds like a limiting reactant problem and yes we can have those for solution Stoichiometry problems as well so I have to take now this is 0.06 liters of zinc chloride and 0.075 liters of sodium phosphate and write that down and for both of these quantities our goal is to convert these to grams of zinc phosphate so way down here at the end our goal is to convert to grams of zinc phosphate so let's go through our first process here we're going to convert to moles so liters on the bottom and moles on the top and once again since this is a solution we have to look at the molarity of the zinc chloride to get our our numbers here so for zinc chloride it's 0.10 molar which is 0.100 moles for every one liter so we can cancel liters and now we can continue with the rest of our Stoichiometry our mole ratio so zinc chloride would have to go on the bottom and zinc phosphate would have to go on the top since that's what we're converting to and the equation tells us that this is a one to three mole ratio based on the coefficients of the balanced equation zinc chloride is out and now I have to convert to grams so moles on the bottom grams on the top if I take three zincs two phosphoruses and eight oxygen atoms and add those together I have a molar mass of about 386.17 grams per mole and I can cancel moles and do some multiplication and division so 0.06 times 0.1 divided by 3 386.17 gets us 0.772 now in a limiting reactant problem we have to do this twice and so in my next process I have to convert to moles so liters on the bottom moles on top now once again I'm using the concentration of sodium phosphate here so it says that I have 0.150 molar sodium phosphate so that means 0.150 moles per liter and so liters are out my second step is the mole ratio so sodium phosphate on the bottom and zinc phosphate on the top and this is a one to two mole ratio according to the coefficients of the balanced equation my sodium phosphate is out and now I'm in moles of zinc phosphate I want to be in grams of zinc phosphate so once again convert to grams so moles on bottom grams on top it's still 386.17 grams in a mole of that so now I calculate and take 0.075 times 0.15 divide by 2 times 386.17 and the answer I get here is 2.17 . now since this is a limiting reactant problem which answer do I go with it's always the lowest isn't it so the answer is the 0.772 grams of zinc phosphate that's how much I would expect to be produced here now which compound is the limiting reactant once again it's the reactant that produces the smaller amount so that would be this zinc chloride right here so I hope that you've been able to learn something about Solutions Stoichiometry some of these problems especially if they're limiting reactant can be kind of long and and lengthy but really it's it's the same as a regular Stoichiometry problem the only difference is in that first step you're going to use your solution concentration that the molarity value to convert to moles my name is Jeremy Krueger I've been teaching AP Chemistry for something like 24 years if you learned something from this video please smash that thumbs up button and join me in the next video where we're going to wrap up unit 4 section 5 by looking at some example problems and applications of solutions Stoichiometry problems,"2,692",0,42
"Solving Problems With Solution Stoichiometry - AP Chem Unit 4, Topic 5d","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to solve various types of problems that involve solution stoichiometry.  In these problems, molarity is used as a conversion factor, and various topics in chemistry are required to solve these problems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9TGx77BWJ8&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=43,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we are going to wrap up unit 4 section 5 which is reaction Stoichiometry and we're going to do that by practicing a few problems here especially using Solutions Stoichiometry so here's the problem we have a balanced equation it says that we're taking a 0.150 gram sample of solid lead II nitrate and it's being added to 125 milliliters of 0.100 molar sodium iodide solution assume no change in the volume of the solution when you add these two substances together and we have the reaction part A and this is a five part question part A says list an appropriate observation that provides evidence of a chemical reaction between the two compounds well one thing that we can notice is that we're taking a solid and we're adding it to an aqueous solution and one of the products is a solid that's called a precipitate so that would be one fairly major observation that you would want to point out that we're going to make a solid precipitate whenever these two reactants are mixed that's the key observation that you would want to to be thinking of now Part B says calculate the number of moles of each reactant well let's try the 0.150 grams of solid lead II nitrate so I'm going to write that down and we're going to convert that just straight to moles this is just a simple grams to moles conversion we're going to have to use the molar mass on the periodic table here so we put grams on the bottom and one mole on top and how many grams are in one mole of lead to nitrate well if you have one lead atom and two nitrogens and six oxygens you add that up you should get about 331.21 grams so we can cancel grams top and bottom and when you divide this out you get an answer of about 4.53 times 10 to the negative fourth moles of lead II nitrate now there's another reactant we have to calculate this for the sodium iodide but this one is in a solution form so we have 0.125 liters and 0.100 Molar so we just have to multiply those numbers by each other and we should get the number of moles of sodium iodides when you do that that should that should be about 0.0125 moles of sodium iodide part C says Identify the limiting reactant and of course show calculations so we're going to take those two mole values that we just calculated and we're going to find out which one is used up first now we need to convert this to uh to a product so I'm just going to use lead to iodide and so I'm going to write this down as moles of lead to iodide and let's convert these and see which one gives us the smaller number so in my first one I'm going to of course these are both in moles so I can go straight to mole ratio so lead 2 nitrate on the bottom and lead to iodide on top and the coefficients tell me that this is a one to one mole ratio so when I look at that it's just the same number of moles of lead to iodide for sodium iodide though sodium iodide on the bottom led to iodide on top this one is a one to two ratio according to the coefficients so when I cancel and divide that out I find that I actually have 6.25 times 10 to the negative third moles of lead to iodide so which of these is the smaller one well it's that one isn't it that's a little bit smaller and so that tells us that the limiting reactant is the reactant that produces that smaller amount so that means lead to nitrate right there is going to be my limiting reactant now Part D says calculate the molar concentration of nitrate ions in the mixture after the reaction is complete so let's take the nitrate now we have to remember that the nitrate didn't really go anywhere I did it because the nitrate first started out here and it ended up in solution so your your nitrate didn't really react to speak of so we started out with 4.53 times 10 to the negative fourth moles of lead II nitrate so let's see how many moles of nitrate ions we have so in my conversion factor looks like a mole ratio here so lead nitrate on the bottom and nitrate on the top and if I look at the formula I can see that this 2 right here tells me that there are two nitrates in every one unit of lead II nitrate so it's actually two nitrates for one lead two nitrate and once again I know that because that little 2 right there tells me that every one of these units has two nitrates in it that's why it's a two to one so lead nitrate goes out when I multiply this across it's 9.06 times 10 to the minus fourth moles of nitrate now the question says the molar concentration that's moles divided by liters now in that header of the problem it said that we had 125 milliliters of solution and so we divide that by 0.125 liters and when I do that I get the final answer of about 7.25 times 10 to the negative third moles per liter of nitrate so once again this is just a simple Stoichiometry problem you have to keep some of these subscripts straight and then remember how to calculate the molarity of this now part e is a graphical question it says Circle the diagram below that best represents the results after the mixture reacts as completely as possible explain the reasoning used in making your choice now some students get caught up on these problems use process of elimination as much as you can use what you know to eliminate the choices that are incorrect so for example there are a couple things that we know we know that lead to iodide is the precipitate the balanced equation just comes right out and tells us that pbi2 is the solid so we can automatically eliminate the first one and the last one because those don't show pbi2 as the solid so we're already down to three choices we also know according to our work in part C that led to nitrate was the limiting reactant that means that there should not be any lead ions swimming around in solution so because of that that means I can I can take this one out because there's a lead ion swimming around in that fourth choice there so I'm already down to two choices it's either number two or number three so the last thing I know is that sodium iodide was the excess reactant that was from the same part C you know if lead 2 nitrate was limiting the other one sodium iodide had to be left over so that means I should be seeing some iodide still swimming around and I don't see that in the second choice whereas I do over here so really the only choice that that makes sense using the things that I know would be the third choice right there so once again when you have a graphical problem like this use what you know to slowly eliminate the choices and get the right answer let's let's try another problem this one is not quite as long this one says a 5.000 gram solid sample contains an unknown amount of chloride a chemist dissolves the solid into distilled water and then adds excess silver nitrate after the reaction the chemist determines that 8.086 grams of silver chloride precipitate was produced determine the percentage of chloride in the original sample this is a very common process this is something called a gravimetric analysis where you might be in the laboratory and you are given a sample in a bottle or a vial and this is you know in this case it's 5 grams in the bottle and your job is to determine what percentage of that bottle is chloride ion so it's actually not too hard to do all we have to do first of all is to get a balanced equation let's let's Write the balanced net ionic equation we know that we are are producing the silver chloride precipitate but we know that we also have silver nitrate so silver ions will be an important part of this it's being added to the chloride ions and of course our precipitate it says is agcl silver chloride so that's the net ionic equation now let's figure out how many moles of chloride we have in that precipitate so we're starting with 8.086 grams of the silver chloride and we're going to try to figure out how many moles of chloride are in that so this is just Stoichiometry so Step One is convert to moles so I can put grams on the bottom moles on top and how many grams are in one mole of silver chloride well Periodic Table Right add those up and the molar mass of this is 143.32 so grams are out and uh this this next step is a mole ratio so silver chloride on the bottom and chloride on the top and right out of our balanced equation this is a one to one mole ratio so silver chloride is out and when you divide this out you find that we have .05642 moles of chloride now if we're trying to find the percentage of chloride by mass we can we can just go ahead and convert the moles to grams I suppose that's step three isn't it convert to final unit so we're going to take that same 0.05642 moles of chloride and determine how many grams of chloride that would be so moles on the bottom grams on top and when I use the periodic table again it's 35.45 grams in one mole of chloride so moles are out when you multiply this across it ends up being about 2.000 grams of chloride in the sample and hopefully at this point you can kind of see where we're going with this what's the mass percent of chloride in that in that sample that we had well we had two grams of chloride the total sample had a mass of about 5 grams so when you divide that out n times it by 100 you find that we have a percentage of about 40 percent chloride in the sample so I hope you've been able to see how Solutions Stoichiometry can be applied in the laboratory and in several problems that you might be asked to work on an exam an AP test or something like that if you learn something here please smash that thumbs up button and join me in my next video where we're going to go on to unit 4 section 6. thanks for

"Introduction to Titration - AP Chemistry Unit 4, Topic 6","In this video, Mr. Krug shows how titration is carried out and why it works.  Various chemical analyses are carried out using titration, and he focuses on the techniques and equipment needed to carry out this process in the chemistry laboratory.  Want more knowledge about titrations?  In the video link below, watch Mr. Krug perform an acid-base titration:      • How to Perform an Acid-Base Titration  ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxdu490P4Tw&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=44,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're taking a look at unit 4 section 6 of AP Chemistry which is all about titrations now there are several types of titrations the most common one that we're going to carry out in AP Chemistry normally is acid-base titration but there are others you can have oxidation reduction reactions in a titration you can have precipitation reactions in titration complex symmetric titrations but the basic idea is that you're going to have a setup that looks kind of like this now this long slender tube this is called a buret and you're going to normally place the base it could be some other substance but usually a base goes in that buret and then in the Erlenmeyer flask down here you're going to place the acid this could be something else but you know generally speaking it'll be the base going in the buret and the acid going in the Erlenmeyer flask and normally the way this works is you'll measure out a very specific amount of acid into that flask using a pipette or some other volumetric instrument and then you'll place the base in this buret and you'll just start titrating you'll open up the the this stopcock down here and allows as much base to flow into the flask until the reaction is complete and the goal is when the reaction is complete you're going to have something called the equivalence point now at the equivalence point the moles of acid in that flask will be exactly equal to the amount of a base that has flowed into that flask as well at that point the reaction has achieved completion and you basically have the well as we say the equivalence point moles of acid equal moles of Base however you probably are aware that most acids are colorless they don't really look like anything and the same is the case with the bases they are colorless as well so the question is how are you going to know that you have reached that equivalence point that point where the reaction is essentially complete as far as we're concerned well you're going to have to put something into this acid in order to indicate that that's the case and we put an acid-base indicator into the acid down here now what that means is when you get to as close to the equivalence point as possible you're going to see some sort of a color change in a lot of cases if it's an indicator called phenolphthalein the colorless acid is going to change to a pink color in some cases and that moment when the color changes is called the end point now if you're doing your job right the end point should be very very close to the equivalence point now not exactly the same thing but they should be really close to each other if you're doing your job right the end point is where your color change indicates that yeah this is where the reaction has essentially completed now let's take a look at a couple of examples here some chemical reactions that are acid-base reactions and these reactions could be carried out using a titration if you wanted to in the first example we have a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid that are added to a solution of sodium fluoride so once again we're going to use the same rules as we did for writing net ionic equations back in section two of this unit so we'll start with the hydrochloric acid we know that that is a strong acid and so you have to write that in its ionized form so we're going to write it as h plus and cl negative since you know strong acids are completely ionized and then we have sodium fluoride well that is a very soluble compound it starts with sodium so we can write sodium fluoride in its ionized form as well completely soluble so it's n a plus and then F negative and just like like we did for all those other init ionic equations back in section two the ions are going to try to swap partners and it's our job to try to determine which one of these pairs is actually going to make something in the reaction well we might remember back to this to our solubility rules we know that sodium chloride is a very soluble ionic compound so that's that's going to remain in ionic form however h plus and F negative well that creates hydrofluoric acid which is a weak acid now it's not so much that hydrofluoric acid is insoluble as it is it is a non-ionized compound and so we want to think of it in that term we're going to take those and put them together to make a weak acid that means that sodium and chloride of course are The Spectator ions and the h plus and F negative will combine in their aqueous forms their to make hydrofluoric acid which is also aqueous so anytime you're creating a weak acid like that it's going to be in the non-ionized form let's try another example of an acid-base reaction dilute sodium hydroxide is titrated into a flask of .10 molar hydrochloric acid so once again we have a strong base which is the case for sodium for sodium hydroxide that means it's going to be completely ionized right strong acids and strong bases are completely ionized and that's the case with hydrochloric acid as well we write that as h plus and cl negative and once again just like in the last example these ions are going to try to swap Partners we know that na plus and cl negative are spectator ions because that would just make a very soluble compound again so that's not going to work so h plus no h negative that's the pair that's going to get together so we're going to make you can probably figure it out it's just water out of this and that means that sodium and chloride are our spectator ions so our our net ionic equation will be h plus aqueous plus o h negative aqueous yields water in its liquid form now just a little shortcut here you'll you'll actually notice that this is going to be the net ionic equation any time you combine a strong acid with a strong base so if you can take a look at an acid-base reaction and recognize that you're adding a strong acid to a strong base you can just skip right ahead and write down h plus plus o h negative yields water as the net ionic equation I hope you learned something about acid-base reactions we're going to talk a little bit more about this here in an upcoming section if you learned something please smash that like button and join me in my next video in which we're going to talk about oxidation reduction reactions in unit 4 section 7. thanks for watching,"3,484",0,44
"Types of Chemical Reactions - AP Chemistry Unit 4, Topic 7A","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses various types of chemical reactions.  He focuses on oxidation-reduction reactions, since these will be new to most students taking AP Chemistry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4khUScKJS8&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=45,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're taking a look at AP Chemistry unit 4 section 7 which is an introduction to oxidation reduction reactions now before we jump into what that actually means let's just review what we've talked about so far as far as chemical reactions we learned about acid-base reactions in the last video and we'll talk about those a bit here later on too but earlier on in this unit in section two we focus on precipitation reactions and that's when you have charged ions moving around swimming around in a solution and they're basically attracted each other forming a solid precipitate so here's an example of one of those we'll balance that equation and if you imagine that we have just a couple of ions around this swimming around in solution we have a lead two plus ion a couple of chloride ions and they get together and they form one unit there of lead to chloride notice that in that reaction you basically didn't have any charge changing you started out with lead ions with a plus two charge and in the final product lead still had a positive two charge as well and we could say the same thing for chloride it starts out with a negative one charge and it maintains that same charge in the product State electrons were not really transferred in fact really the only thing that happened was that these ions got together because of what we could call electrostatic attractions the fact that positive ions are attracted to negative ions and they get together well in this section we're going to learn about a new type of reaction this is something that's called an oxidation reduction reaction where electrons are actually transferred over the course of the reaction so let's say we have this process here calcium and sulfur yields calcium sulfur and we can imagine there's one atom of calcium over here and it I have it drawn with two valence electrons as it does and here I have the sulfur with six valence electrons and they want to get together well what's going to happen is calcium is going to donate these two valence electrons right here to the sulfur There's an actual transfer of the electrons as you can see and when that happens or I should say after that happens you now have calcium with a two plus charge and sulfide with a negative charge and then they're able to get together by that electrostatic attraction but notice that was only able to occur because there was a transfer of electrons that did not happen in that previous reaction so in this reaction we can see that calcium lost electrons and sulfur gained electrons now anytime an atom loses electrons we can say it is oxidized oxidation very simply put just means the losing of electrons by an atom or an ion or species in a reaction and likewise anytime an atom gains electrons like we have here with sulfur we say it is reduced so once again in its simplest State the word reduction in chemistry just means something that has gained electrons it could be an atom an ion some other species oxidation is losing electrons reduction is gaining electrons now let's take a look at this from a different point of view we're going to look at the same reaction where we have calcium starting out with a charge of zero okay in this other case sulfur is also a neutral atom with a charge of zero but notice what happens to these two atoms over the course of the reaction after calcium donates those two electrons calcium actually has a new charge the charge of calcium went up it went from 0 up to a positive two anytime you have a charge of something that goes up like that that is also oxidation and notice that the charge of the sulfur went down it started out at zero it went down to negative two that's another way of looking at the reduction so a couple ways that we can think about oxidation and reduction we said oxidation means it loses electrons in terms of charge that means its charge goes up when we talk about reduction it's gaining electrons in terms of charge that means its charge goes down it's really just a couple different ways of saying the same thing but sometimes there are students that see one way is easier to to look at than another let's just take a look at what we're talking about overall here in oxidation reduction reactions or what we're probably going to call redox that's just a little shorthand name for that an element is oxidized when it loses electrons and then something else is going to be reduced when it gains electrons now there are a couple of a Nifty mnemonic aids to help you remember this some students use Leo the Lion goes gur and basically the idea is that losing electrons oxidation and gaining electrons reduction so you hopefully you get it there Leo the Lion goes gur some students don't like that and they like to think of an oil rig oil rig stands for oxidation is losing reduction is gaining so we have a couple of nifty mnemonic AIDS you can use to help you remember that now redox reactions are all over the place I don't think that redox reactions are something that you've never seen before that we're just introducing for the first time today to be honest a lot of reactions that we would normally call single replacement or single displacement reactions that you learned about in your first year chemistry course those are very often also redox reactions in fact a lot of those we're going to be considering here in our upcoming videos about redox you'll also find that a lot of synthesis reactions even some decomposition reactions can correctly be classified as redox the one that we looked at here just a minute ago that is a synthesis reaction but it also is a redox in fact we're going to find that even in combustion reactions are very correctly classified as redox reactions let's take a look at an example here now the most common redox reaction that we're going to look at in AP Chemistry involves a metal being added to a metallic ion Metals reacting with with metal ions like in this case magnesium metal is added to a solution of zinc chloride now let's write the net ionic equation for this and see what's happening here we know how to write magnesium that's just mg just plain old mg and then we have zinc chloride which is in a solution so we have to write it in its ionized form so that's zn2 plus and cl negative now when you're writing these redox reactions you need to understand that if you see a metal that means it's going to react with a metal ion so you need to be able to recognize that these two things here these two species the magnesium and the zinc the metal and that metal ion are going to react with each other that means that the chloride that's just a spectator ion so you don't even have to worry about the chloride that's just going to be kind of sitting out on the sidelines here now what's going to happen well the Magnesium is going to change into some other form of magnesium and the zinc is going to change into some other form of Zinc now one other form of magnesium is there well there's there are magnesium ions aren't there that's mg2 plus that's how you write the the symbol for magnesium ions it just changes charge to its ion form how about the zinc ions well the other form of Zinc that we know of is just zinc metal isn't it so we write that as just ZN and that's basically what's happening the metal is going to be oxidized and the metal ion is going to be reduced into its metal form that's in its simplest form what's going to happen in a whole lot of these redox reactions so if we leave out the spectator ion we can realize that the Magnesium is oxidized the zinc ions are reduced and we can write the overall net ionic equation like this mg solid plus zn2 plus in its aqueous form yields mg2 Plus in its aqueous form and zinc solid and generally speaking when we have reactions like this like I said the metals are oxidized the metal ions end up being reduced now as you look at this redox reaction it's fairly simple to isolate the charge that everything has we know that that zinc has a plus two charge that magnesium has a plus two charge these elements magnesium and zinc those are well those are zero they don't have any charge but as we go through some of these other examples it's going to be a little harder to tell what the charge or the oxidation state as we sometimes call it of these species are so what we're going to do is devote an entire video to how to determine oxidation state that's going to be coming up in our next video so join me for that hope if you if you learn something from this video give me a thumbs up if you would and join me for my next video about oxidation state

"How to Determine Oxidation State for ANY Atom - AP Chem Unit 4, Topic 7b","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to determine the oxidation state for any atom in any compound or substance.  He works several examples over the course of the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEvI8yiSnxE&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=46,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to learn how to determine the oxidation state or the charge of any atom in pretty much any compound that you could ever encounter now there are some very specific rules that you have to follow in order to do this but if you follow the rules you're going to be able to determine the charge of any atom in any compound that you could ever encounter so if you learn something from this video please shoot me a thumbs up and leave a comment down there below in those comment sections and I would really appreciate that well the first rule that you need to know is that Elements by themselves always have an oxidation state a charge of zero so we can just look at pretty much any element like you know zinc metal iron metal those are going to be zero even diatomic elements Like Oxygen you know still going to be zero even if they have polyatomic elements like in the case of phosphorus or sometimes times sulfur still going to be zero the charge of of those atoms in any element just by itself is going to be a zero now when you have an ion that's by itself it's going to take whatever charge it happens to be labeled with and so this is also once again very easy to isolate that zinc ion has a charge of positive two and we know that because there's a little plus 2 right there or this iron is a positive 3 because it says plus three that oxide is of course negative two that phosphide ion is negative three if at this point you feel that this is just too easy well just wait it does get a little bit harder generally speaking when you're looking at compounds alkali metals we're talking about those those elements that are in group one the far left hand side of the table those are positive one and alkaline earth metals are positive two the ones in the second column of the table so for example sodium chloride this sodium right here is an Alkali metal so it's going to have an oxidation state of plus one and calcium fluoride this calcium is an alkaline earth metal so it has a charge of positive two and lithium nitride that lithium is an Alkali metal so it's got a positive one charge if we know what one of the one of the elements will be in a compound we can use algebra or simple math to figure out the oxidation state of the other elements in a binary compound and the reason for that is that all compounds have a total oxidation state of zero and if you encounter a polyatomic ion it has a total oxidation state of whatever its charge is and you can use Simple algebra or math to use the oxidation states that you know to solve for the ones that you don't so what I mean is in the case of this compound here sodium chloride we know that this sodium right here of course is a positive one just like we said earlier so since this entire compound has to add up to zero that means that the chloride right here has to be a negative one in its oxidation state if we try this compound here calcium fluoride we said earlier that calcium is plus two that means that the two fluorides overall have to be negative two but there are two of them so we have to divide that negative two well in half basically and that means that each of the fluorides will have a negative one as its oxidation state so we can use the the oxidation states that we know to solve for the ones that we don't know same thing here we have zinc and nitride well you know you can basically unswap the charges we know that zinc when it's an ion is always plus two and we have two of those actually we have three of those excuse me and so that's a total of plus six that means that these nitrides have to have a total of negative six between those two so negative six divided by 2 would be negative three so each of the nitrides is a negative three of course you could just unswap those charges and say that that 3 means that the nitride is negative three and this two means that zinc is plus two you can do that as well there are a couple different ways to to solve these now in a compound oxygen is pretty much always going to be negative two there is an exception to that if you see a peroxide oxygen in a peroxide is negative one but in all common uh in in all honesty that's not that common so just be aware that oxygen in a peroxide is negative one but pretty much you know ninety percent of the time oxygen is going to be a negative two so like in this case we know that the oxygen is negative two and we have three of those so that gives us a total of negative six that means that the iron has to to account for a positive six between those two atoms there so the only way for that to work is to have two ions of plus three a piece so that tells us that the oxidation state of iron is plus three the oxygen of course is negative two we can try carbon dioxide now once again the oxygen is negative two and we have two of those so that gives it gives us a total of negative four that means that the carbon in order to balance that out has to be positive four so once again what you want to do is find the element that is the most obvious and then work backwards from there to solve for the oxidation state of any uh of those elements that you don't know same thing here dinitrogen tetroxide oxygen is is a minus two and we have four of those and that gives us a total of negative eight well that means that these two nitrogens have to have a total of positive eight if that's the case so what we do is we divide it by the two and that's positive four so that means that each nitrogen has to have a charge of positive four you can see how this works use what you know to solve for what you don't know generally speaking hydrogen is going to be positive one when it's bonded to a non-metal and that's about probably 95 percent of the cases that you'll find maybe even more than that I don't know very rarely or very occasionally hydrogen will be bonded to a metal in what's called a hydride ion if that's ever the case then the hydrogen is going to be a negative one in that case so let's try this one hbr so once again it's bonded to a non-metal so hydrogen is going to have a a positive one charge which means the bromine has to be negative one in its oxidation state and we can try this one here calcium hydride in this case the hydrogen is bonded to a metal so the H would have to be a negative whoops a negative one and we have two of those so that's a total of negative two and of course that means calcium would have to be a positive two which you probably knew that anyway so there we can see how to uh to to determine the oxidation states of different substances sometimes it's not obvious sometimes you don't have perhaps one that you can look at like a sodium or something like that if the elements are not obvious focus on the most electronegative atom that's in the compound you can usually predict that from the periodic table so for example if we have carbon tetrabromide we know that bromine that's the most electronegative element there in that compound that's the farthest right on the table so it's a halogen and so it's negative one so bromine has to have a negative one charge and there are four of those and so that's a total of negative four which tells us that the carbon has to be positive 4. so we can figure that out let's try nitrogen trifluoride well once again of the two here fluorine is the most electronegative and so we can predict that from the periodic table it's in the group 17 so it has a negative one charge got three of them so that means that we have a total of negative three which means that nitrogen has to be positive three now you might not have guessed that nitrogen could have a plus three charge but in this in this particular compound it actually does have that oxidation state how about phosphorus pentachloride well the same idea here chlorine is the halogen it's the most electronegative of the two elements and so we can predict it from the table it's a negative one and there are a whopping five of those so that means that the five chlorines have a total charge of negative five and that means that the phosphorus would have to be positive five and once again maybe by looking at the periodic table you would not have guessed phosphorus to be a positive five but in this particular compound that is its oxidation state now let's practice here let's determine the oxidation state of all atoms in the following species here so let's try the nitrate polyatomic ion once again the idea is use what you know to solve for what you don't know so we know that oxygen is going to be a negative two and we really don't know what the nitrogen is going to be so let's use algebra to figure this out so nitrogen we don't know what that is let's call it X and then the three oxygens at negative two a piece would be negative 6 and the entire ion adds up to a negative one this little minus sign right there tells us that so we can just use algebra to solve for x and see that x equals positive 5. and so that means that nitrogen would have to be positive 5 in this particular substance about sodium dichromate well once again use what you know to solve for what you don't know we know that sodium is a positive one we know that oxygen is a negative two we don't really know about that chromium do we it's a transition metal those could have all kinds of charges so let's set up a little algebra problem here we have two sodiums at plus one a p so that's that's a plus two we don't know what the chromium will be and we have two of those so let's just call that 2X and we have seven oxygens at negative two a piece so let's call that negative 14. and since this is a a compound it's going to add up to zero so now all we have to do is solve for x so when we simplify that maybe 2x minus 12 equals 0 and then carry the minus 12 to the other side and we can see that the x is going to equal positive 6. that means that the oxidation state of that chromium right there is actually a positive six once again you might not have guessed that but chromium can certainly be a positive six let's do a little bit more practice here we're going to determine the oxidation state of all atoms in the following species so we'll start with sulfur dioxide once again the key is isolate one element that you're sure of the one that's the most obvious and work backwards from there so we know oxygen looks to be the most obvious one I'd call that a minus two and we have so that's a total of negative four which means that the sulfur has to be positive four now it doesn't you can use algebra you can just eyeball that and see that sulfur has to be positive four either way works how about carbon disulfide in this one it's not really obvious either one of those so let's focus on the most electronegative of those two to most electronegative would have to be sulfur so that's the one that we're going to pinpoint the first so that sulfur it's in group 16 those are negative 2. so if you want to use algebra the carbon we can call that X and two of these sulfurs would be negative four and that of course adds up to zero so that means that the carbon would have to be a positive four once again you might not have seen that to be obvious but once you know the rules you can work the problem and figure out what the oxidation state of any of these atoms would be let's try the sulfate polyatomic ion once again it may not be obvious but looks like the oxygen is the most obvious here the oxygen is negative two and we don't know what sulfur is so let's just call that sulfur X and since we have four oxygens at negative two a piece let's call that negative eight and then the whole thing is going to add up to a negative 2 because that minus 2 right there gives us the total charge so when you solve for x you'll find that x equals positive 6. that means that the sulfur has to have a charge of positive six now let's take this concept of determining oxidation States and take a look at an example problem now we said in the last video that there are lots of special types of redox reactions that deserve special attention we know that actually the combustion of hydrocarbons that is a type of redox reaction and if you have a hydrocarbon and it's combusted completely in oxygen gas the products will always be carbon dioxide in water so if you have this reaction right here or a sample of the methane gas is burned in air hopefully you will remember from unit one or actually unit 0 of this series anyway the methane is CH4 and we're burning it in air so that means we're adding it to O2 and the products of course are carbon dioxide and water so that's how you'd write this now let's balance the equation and we're going to go one step further and determine the oxidation state of all elements in that reaction so let's start with this methane here this CH4 on the left now if we look at that we should remember that the most obvious one is the hydrogen and since it is you know in a compound here it's going to be a positive one and there are four of those so that means that it's going to be a negative 4 for carbon you can just pinpoint that just just as you see it there since it's bonded to a non-metal hydrogens is going to be a plus one there are four of them so your carbon has to be negative four the oxygen over here it's just a a plain old element oxygen gas so it's going to be zero and then carbon dioxide same process here the oxygen is a minus two and there are two of those so it's a minus four so your carbon has to be plus four once again use what you know to solve for what you don't know in water you could probably figure out either of these but oxygen minus two so hydrogen has to be positive one once you divide Out Among those two right there so these are the oxidation states of all the atoms all the elements in this reaction and if you get that then you can look at this reaction and realize well take a look here carbon's charge is going up that's going from negative four up to positive 4. so when a charge goes up that's called oxidation isn't it so carbon is being oxidized in this process and then take a look at this oxygen its charge is going down from zero down to negative two so that means that oxygen is being reduced since this charge is going down so you can use this concept of determining oxidation state if you need to to determine what's being oxidized and reduced in a reaction I hope you've learned how to determine oxidation state now if you have then please go ahead and smash that thumbs up button and I hope to see you on my next video where we're going to jump back to acids and bases and look at those reactions for a brief bit thanks for watching,"2,765",0,46
"Introduction to Acid-Base Chemistry - AP Chemistry Unit 4, Topic 8","In this video, Mr. Krug gives an introduction to acid-base reactions, discussing how to identify Arrhenius acids and Arrhenius bases.  He spends the bulk of the video discussing Bronsted-Lowry acids and Bronsted-Lowry bases and how to isolate conjugate acid-base pairs in a chemical reaction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX7soWYIGv8&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=47,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to deepen our understanding of acids and bases we're in unit four section 8 of AP Chemistry now you probably have learned a little bit about acids and bases already you know some of the basics that they've been studied for a long time and if you wanted to talk about acids and bases we know that acids are known for corroding metals they eat through things as you've probably learned already and they can also be used for cleaning things as well uh of course I'm not encouraging people to go eating chemicals or anything but there are some dilute acids that are found in foods like vinegar and citric acid if you've ever had those in your mouth you know that they have kind of a sour taste to them on the other hand the bases are generally known for their cleansing properties like uh soap is probably one of the most common bases that you're familiar with on a daily basis or a drain cleaner or window cleaner uh these are bases they're usually pretty good at cleaning things uh if you have a base and you rub it between your fingers you'll find that it has a very slippery feel to it uh just like soap essentially soap being a base it has that slippery feeling as you rub it between your fingers now when we ask chemically what is an acid well it's basically anything that produces hydrogen ions in a solution so if you're looking at the chemical formula the easiest way to recognize an acid is just by looking at its formula and you'll see that it starts with hydrogen so something like you know any of these here we have formulas that start with hydrogen and they're all acids and you probably know some of the names of these like Hydrochloric and hydrofluoric and nitric acid we have Carbonic down there we have some others but those are pretty common acids they start with hydrogen what is it a base well a base is anything that produces hydroxide ions in a solution and likewise if you're trying to figure out what a base is going to be like you can look at its formula and it's going to end with a hydroxide so anything like this you have sodium hydroxide calcium hydroxide all those hydroxides that we've looked at those are bases now the person who came up with these descriptions was a Swedish chemist named Sante arenius who came up with that well over 100 years ago so when we think about acids and bases we can call these arenus acids and arous bases usually uh when we look at arenus acids they're going to dissociate very simply when you add them to water so that means something like this you take HCL and it just dissociates it breaks apart into its component ions we could say the same thing for perchloric acid it's going to break apart as well just into its component ions H+ and perchlorate arenus bases they do the same thing as well they just break apart into their component ions so there we have potassium hydroxide producing those two ions and calcium hydroxide producing its two ions now in this case we have two hydroxides so that's why there's a a two right there let's take a look at an example problem with arenus bases let's imagine that we have a point 70 molar solution of calcium hydroxide that is prepared from solid calcium hydroxide and distilled water determine the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution well it might be useful to have the actual equation here so we can look at that so there's the equation for the dissociation of calcium hydroxide in aquous solution and we know that the concentration of calcium hydroxide is 70 so we can use Simple stochiometry to look at the mole ratios here the calcium ion it's a 1: one ratio so the calcium ion would also be 70 molar isn't it of course that's not what the question is asking it's asking what's the concentration of hydroxide well that is a 1:2 ratio so the hydroxide concentration is going to be twice what the other concentrations are it's 1.4 0 moles per liter and that's the answer now if that's all we had to say about acids and bases well Unit 8 would be very very simple wouldn't it because that's our acid base unit which we'll delve into much more deeply later in this course but as it turns out there is a definition that is much more inclusive because if you've learned a whole lot about acids and bases even what we've learned about in this course already you know that a lot of weak bases even some of the weak acids that we've talked about already don't really qualify as arous acids and bases that arous definition that we've given you know if it if it's an acid it starts with H if it's a base it ends with hydroxide that's very limiting and if we stick to the arenus definition we're going to exclude a lot in fact if not most substances that are actually acids or bases in the real world so there's another definition that is a whole lot more inclusive and this is the one that we're going to be focusing on in AP Chemistry and this is a definition that was first produced by Johan brunede and that's an interesting concept an acid has to react with a base and when they react with each other they form another acid and another base and let's take a look at how that works here's a here's a compound that if you didn't know much about this compound you might not know if it were an acid or a base it has h on the front of it but it also has o on the end so for some students that are starting out it might be confusing but we find that when you react this with water it produces two compounds or I should say two ions more correctly it produces the ion h3o+ which is aquous and that's called the hydronium ion we're going to be taking a look at that in much more detail in the acid base unit Unit 8 and we also have Co negative aquous so if we look at this chemical reaction we can figure out that there's an acid reacting with a base on the reactant side and since this is a reversible reaction the other side has an acid reacting with a base as well so it goes both ways now according to Bron stead and Lowry an acid is a proton donor that's all that an acid is it's a proton donor and likewise a base is a proton acceptor now before we go too far into this it would be helpful to know that when we say proton a proton is just an H+ ion if you know that that actually makes your life a whole lot simpler an acid is an H+ donor a base is an H+ acceptor so if we go back to that equation and we focus on the left side can you see what's the donor and what's the acceptor well it looks like the H Co compound is the proton donor we know that because on the other side it basically has an H that has fallen off the front of it so we know that this compound has to be the acid we know that the water is acting as a base we know that because if we look at the other side water all of a sudden has another H+ tacked onto it and it has turned into hydronium so we have an acid and a base now on the other side since this is a reversible reaction it can go backwards as well and we can do the same thing for the other side and we see that if this reaction were going in reverse the hydronium ion is the acid in fact we call this the conjugate acid since it's going in reverse here and the co negative ion is the conjugate base so every acid base reaction is going to have a pair of acids and bases in fact if we take this acid it looks a whole lot like that conjugate base we call that a conjugate acid base pair in fact they only differ from each other by one proton by one H+ and the same thing with the water and the hydronium they look pretty close to each other they only differ from each other because the conjugate acid has one more H+ than its conjugate base so we have two conjugate acid base pairs in every one of these uh acid base reac reactions so let's take a look at another reaction and let's try to to figure out some things about this let's take a look at the hcn here this reaction and let's first of all label the acid as we have in 1 a so which one is the acid well you can probably figure it out just by looking at it you can probably see that you know this is an H so yeah that's an acid but if you're not sure just remember that it's donating the H+ to the water we know that because on the other side of the arrow an H+ has fallen off it's not there anymore now that means that water is acting as a base isn't it an acid always reacts with a base that's why these are called acid base reactions not acid acid reactions or base Bas reactions acid base the acid reacts with the base now on the other side of the arrow we can figure out conjugate acid and conjugate base because if we go in reverse we see that this hydronium is donating to the cyanide ion so the hydronium is the conjugate acid and the cyanide would have to be the conjugate base and we can identify the two conjugate acid base pairs as well we have this acid the hcn that looks a whole lot like that cyanide ion doesn't it that's a conjugate acid based pair and here's another conjugate acid based pair as well the water and the hydronium so the hydronium is the acid and the water is the base in that pair so for any one of these acidbase reactions you should be able to isolate all of these things and isolate the two conjugate acid base pairs that are present now we've looked at two reactions that are acids but why don't we look at the bases like I said and this is on the on the screen here officially here in every conjugate acid base the acid will always have one more H+ than the base and we see that's the case here all right let's go on and take a look at a base so here we're going to consider the dissociation of ammonia in water and its formula of course is NH3 so part A says write the base dissociation equation for ammonia works the same way we know it's going to be in water so we have to add the H2O and since this is a base we know it's going to be accepting the H+ this time so if it's accepting an H+ the one of the products has to be nh4+ that's the only way it could be written if it's accepting an H+ and then what's left well if water is going to be donating the H+ this time and you hack off an H+ from that all you're left with is hydroxide I think it's some level that kind of makes sense though that in a base you make hydroxide in an acid we seem to be making hydronium like we did in those last two examples so here's part A that's the equation so let's identify the base well in Part B that's base which means that water has to be acid and in the other direction here we can see that this ammonium is donating the H+ to hydroxide if you're going in the opposite direction so ammonium would be the conjugate acid and hydroxide would have to be the conjugate base so there we have part B now you might notice that in this reaction we have water acting as an acid in the last reaction in fact the last two reactions water was the base so we have water that can be either an acid or a base depending on the reaction and that is something called an aoic substance when something can be either an acid or a base that's called amphoteric and we'll find a few substances that are amphoteric as we work through the acid base section later on in Unit A the part C says point out the two conjugate acid base pairs well there's the base do you see the conjugate acid that looks a whole lot like it well yeah that would be the ammonium so there we have a conjugate acid base pair and then here's another conjugate acid base pair the water paired up with the hydroxide so as you can see here this is a an an introduction to acid base chemistry we're just barely dipping our finger into that because we're going to hit uh acidbase chemistry fairly heavily in Unit 8 so stay tuned for that I hope you learned something about arenus acids and bases and bronze dead Lowry acids and bases if you did go ahead and smash that thumbs up button and join me in my next video where we're going to be moving on to unit 4 section n where we're going to be going back to redo reactions and getting a lot of practice

First, he shows how halogens can react with halide ions (and when they don't!).  Then, he focuses on disproportionation reactions and how to balance these unusual reactions.  Finally, he covers reactions of metals in acid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiNKXlhy0Ww&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=49,hi there my name is Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to move right along with the next part of unit 4 section 9 which is about redox reactions in the last video we looked at the most common types of redox reactions which are metals being reacted with metal ions in this video we're going to start by looking at reactions of halogens now like we said last time we normally oxidize Metals well non-metals tend to be reduced they have their Elemental state which has a charge of course zero and then they tend to go down in charge which means that they have to gain electrons which is a reduction now there's an activity series for halogens and if you look at this activity series you'll see that it's basically synonymous with the halogen group just written out from top to bottom on Group 17 of the periodic table and the way this works is that halogens on this activity series can be reduced by the ions that are underneath them on the list so that makes it rather rather simple for us to keep that straight so for example if we have F2 fluorine gas being reacted with bromine ions well we see that yes that's going to work because fluorine can be reduced by pretty much any other halogen because fluorine is on top so yeah we're going to have fluoride and then bromine is going to be the other product of course you want to balance that like this on the other hand if you have bromine liquid being added to chloride ions well notice that here's here's bromine and chloride is above it so that's a no reaction since a halogen cannot be reduced by the ions that are above it on that hierarchy there let's take a look at this one how about bromine liquid being added to iodide ions well that one is going to work isn't it because bromine is here iodide ions are underneath so we're going to make bromide ions be our negative and then iodine solid which is I2 and of course you want to balance that equation so let's try an example let's say we have pure chlorine gas that is bubbled into a solution of potassium iodide well the first thing you want to realize is that the potassium is The Spectator this time so chlorine gas is cl2 and it's going to react with iodide ions so that's I negative so of course potassium that doesn't have anything to do with this so what is chlorine going to turn into well the other form of chlorine that we know of is chloride so we'll have two chloride ions produced and then in the other half reaction here the iodide is going to be converted into iodine in its Elemental form so very similar to how the metals and the metallic ions work they basically swap States for all practical purposes for lack of a better term the the elemental form is going to turn into the ionic form and the one that's an ion is going to turn into the elemental form now of course we have to balance these half reactions and put a 2 right there and on this one we have a charge of zero as opposed to a charge of negative two so to balance the first half reaction I need two electrons on the left side to make that work out and then on the other one we have negative 2 here versus zero so two electrons go on the right side this time so since the first one is gaining electrons that's reduction and since the second one here is losing electrons we call that oxidation well now we're ready to add these half reactions together and we notice that the two electrons will basically disappear once we add these together so this is okay to add together and so here is our overall balanced equation we have chlorine gas and two iodide ions reacting to produce two chloride ion ions and iodine solid so that's how you would work a problem with the halogen that is redox as well now there are a lot of the miscellaneous redox reactions that you need to be aware of some of these are just simple synthesis reactions that you probably learned how to write in a first year chemistry class if you have pure elements that are combining or they're reacting with each other to make a compound that's a redox reaction if you have an element burned that means it's being reacted with oxygen that's a redox reaction as well and you need to be aware of how that works so for example if we have a piece of sodium metal that's placed into a beaker containing pure chlorine gas well you need to know that the sodium metal is in a in its Elemental State and the pure chlorine gas is cl2 don't forget that it's diatomics we have to write it as cl2 and when you put those together you make the ionic compound sodium chloride which hopefully you know is written as NaCl now notice this is solid this is not ionic the reason for that is because there is no water that's mentioned in the question so NaCl has to be solid it's not solution so we just write it like this of course you have to balance the equation we can balance the chlorine atoms and then the sodium atoms and now we have a balanced equation and hopefully you can look at that and see that the sodium is being oxidized and the chlorine is being reduced how about this one how about iron filings and sulfur flowers are heated together vigorously in a crucible so in this case we have iron so that is Fe solid and then we have sulfur which is s solid and if it's heated together vigorously they're going to form an ionic compound so that compound is going to be f e s in the next example we have a strip of magnesium metal is burned in air so once again we have magnesium metal which is just mg solid and anytime you burn something when you burn something in air you're always reacting it with oxygen gas and so the other reactant would be O2 so that's what burning in air means now the ionic compound that's formed from this will be of course magnesium oxide and you'll write that as MGO because magnesium is a plus two and oxides minus two when you balance that you have balance of magnesiums and the oxygens like that and so now we have the overall balanced equation and of course you can look at this and see that magnesium is being oxidized and the oxygen gas is being reduced how about sulfur is burned in air same type of deal this time we have sulfur s solid and burning in air means it's being reacted with O2 and so the product sometimes is not obvious in this case it's just sulfur dioxide for the most part and that's the balanced equation that's all you have to to write so you can take a look at that a redox reaction right there how about a piece of sodium metal is burned in air same type of problem here we have sodium metal this time sodium solid and we're burning in air so that's O2 being added to that and so the ionic compound that's produced from this combination is going to be sodium oxide and the formula for that is na2o because of course sodium is a plus one and oxide is a minus two so you have to swap the charges now when you balance the equation looks like we have to balance the oxygens like this and then we have four sodiums so a four goes over here so that's how you write these miscellaneous redox reactions that many of which you'll find are actually synthesis reactions now we're going to take a look at a special type of reaction here a disproportionation reaction now this is a special type of redox reaction in which you'll find that the same element is actually being oxidized and reduced at the same time now maybe you're wondering how in the world can that happen well let's take a look at a couple of examples here let's say we have a piece of copper metal is dropped into a solution of copper to sulfate so we know that copper and copper 2 have to be reacting in this in this process here because in the most common redox processes metals are going to react with metal ions and that's what we have here we have copper that's the metal and of course copper II is the metal ion so we're going to have those as the reactants and in one of these cases the copper is going to be oxidized in the other case the copper two ions will be reduced the neat thing about this is the product in each of these cases will be the same ion so can you think of a form of copper that has a charge in between 0 and positive 2. well there was only one possibility right it has to be copper with a positive one charge and that's what both of these forms of copper will turn into so you'll have you know this Copper at the plus two copper zero and they meet in the middle so it's kind of a I guess a a convergence of these two charges and to balance these we need to have a an electron over here and in the second one we will need to have an electron over here so once again we can add these together and you'll you'll notice that the the single electron will disappear once we add these together so in the overall balanced equation it's copper metal plus a copper two plus ion yields two copper one ion the copper is being oxidized the copper II ions are being reduced so that's a disproportionation reaction now we can do one that's somewhat different from this this is also disproportionation this says a solution of Iron II chloride is allowed to stand in a beaker for several months now you might look at that question and say well what what in the world is going on here it doesn't look like there's much of a reaction but as it turns out in this case it's the Iron II that's reacting essentially with itself and that means that the Iron II has to be both oxidized and reduced so in this case we're just going to write iron two plus as the reactant in both of the half reactions and can you think of two other forms of iron maybe one that's higher than iron two plus and one that's lower than iron two plus well if you think about the ion chart and how we've had some experience with iron and some of these elements you probably know that Iron II plus can become just regular iron metal it can be reduced and so that's one of the products and then there's another form of iron that has a charge higher than two plus it's iron three plus and so in this case we have the charges that are actually diverging we have both that start out at iron two one goes up to plus three one goes down to zero so now we just have to balance these we're going to need it looks like two electrons on on the left side over here and then in the second half reaction we're going to need one electron on the right side so now we're ready to add these up we are going to have to multiply equation number two by two aren't we to make those two electrons disappear whenever we add them to each other so we're going to have to do this and now we're ready to add the half reaction so our overall balanced equation is three iron two ions yield iron metal plus two iron three plus ions so in this case we see that the iron two ions are being reduced and in the second one these these iron two ions are actually being oxidized so there are some disproportionation reactions and if you get some practice with this you'll find that once you know what to look for they're not that hard to do as you can see now generally speaking in order for a disproportionation reaction to work an element must have at least three oxidation States so that's why transition metals are very common for these types of of reactions because in the case of iron just as an example you have two ion forms as well as one elemental form you have iron two plus iron three plus and then just plain old iron metal and that's the way it it works with copper as well you have copper one copper two and and just copper metal so that's why transition metals are the most common cases with these disproportionation reactions now there's one last example that I'd like to share with you about these special cases of uh redox reactions and that's Metals reacting with most strong acids usually when you react to metal with a strong acid you're going to get hydrogen gas as the product that is actually produced from those hydrogen positive ions now I'm going to leave out nitric acid in the next video we'll actually see what happens to nitric acid it actually doesn't work like this nitrogen nitric acid is a special case but let's try an example where we have a piece of iron metal is dropped into hydrobromic acid well you see Iron Metal so that's our our Fe as we write that down you want to remember that anytime you have a strong acid and a redox reaction the only important part of the strong acid that we actually care about would be the h plus the bromide in the hydrobromic acid is just a spectator ion so we're not going to worry about that so the iron is going to be oxidized as most metals will do and you know the most common form of that in solution is iron two plus and then h plus we said well that's going to produce hydrogen gas so that's going to be H2 and of course we need to to balance these so two electrons on the right side here will balance that on the second half reaction I need to balance the hydrogen atoms first and then I can put two electrons over here to balance my plus two versus the zero charge so put a two electrons right there and now looks like I'm ready to add these together and these two electrons will disappear when I add them together so I can see that my overall balanced equation is iron solid plus two hydrogen ions yield iron two plus ions plus hydrogen gas so these are some special cases with redox once again some of these you have to be on the lookout for especially some of those disproportionation reactions but with practice you'll get pretty good at writing these hope you enjoyed the video hope you learned something that something from this if you did please smash that thumbs up button and I hope to see you in the next video where we're going to learn how to balance some more complicated redox reactions thanks for watching,"1,844",0,49
"Balancing Oxidation-Reduction Reactions - AP Chem Unit 4, Topic 9c","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to balance more complex oxidation-reduction reactions using the half-reaction method, both in acidic solution and in basic solution.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aypxLKg9B8&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=50,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to wrap up unit 4 section 9 where we're going to learn how to balance some more complicated redox reactions now there are some redox reactions that take place in the presence of acid and as you look at these three you'll notice that some of them look a little bit unusual for example the dichromate ion ends up being turned into chromium three plus ions and the permanganate ion ends up being turned into manganese too and the nitrate ion ends up being turned into nitrogen a monoxide gas well the question is how do you balance these half reactions how do you balance for example a half reaction where there are four oxygens over here but there aren't any oxygens on the right side well there's a very special way to do that so in this one we have iron ii ions are added to an acidic solution containing dichromate ions producing iron three ions and chromium three ions so once again we're going to start with the iron two plus and it says we're also adding it to dichromate so we write the formula for dichromate ions and in this problem it is kind of nice it tells us what the products are we're going to make iron three plus and chromium three ions so let's balance these now the first half reaction is fairly simple to balance we have a plus two versus a plus three so we just need a a single electron on the right side over here though this is much more complicated how do you balance that well there's a step-by-step process so let's go through those steps the first step is you want to balance everything other than hydrogen and oxygen so as you look at this half reaction you'll notice that there are two chromiums right here there's only one chromium on the right side so I'm going to put a 2 right there to get those chromium atoms all balanced now in my second step I'm going to balance the oxygen atoms and the way I do that is I notice I have seven oxygen atoms right here but I don't have any on the other side so I'm going to balance this out by adding seven water molecules over here just like this now all of a sudden I have the same number of oxygen atoms on both sides of the arrow the reason I can do this by the way is that we are in a solution and so we know that water is present and so water must be participating in this process in order for this to work now the third step here is to take care of my hydrogens because you might notice that I just solved my oxygens but now I have created a hydrogen problem so the way I do that as I balance the hydrogen atoms by adding the appropriate number of hydrogen ions to the other side of the arrow so in this case I just added 14 you know 7 times 2 is 14. so I have to add 14 H pluses to the other side like this now the reason this works is that this is an acidic solution and since this is an acidic solution I know that there are some hydrogen ions that have to be swimming around in the solution and they must be participating in order for this to work well now I can balance my charge because all my atoms are balanced so sometimes this can be a little bit tricky this will be very careful in how you balance the charge on the left side I have a total charge of positive 12 because I have plus 14 and minus 2 right there so that's a plus 12. over here on the right side I have Plus 6. so the way I balance out plus 12 versus plus 6 is I have to put six electrons on the left side over here just like this so now I'm ready to add these two half reactions together and like always I want the electrons to disappear when I add these together and that's not going to happen unless I multiply uh half reaction number one by six so if I do this now those electrons will fall out disappear when I add them together so I get the overall balanced equation that looks like this and just so you know I have uh I've basically omitted the the states the the aqueous and the liquid over here just for brevity's sake because I don't have enough room but you can see the overall balanced equation for this redox reaction that's all you have to do this is a rather complicated process but with some practice you can get the hang of it now as you can see the first half reaction is oxidation because we are losing electrons the second half reaction is reduction since we're gaining electron let's take a look at another example here in this case we have a skeleton redox reaction written we're going to need to separate these out into the half reaction so in the first half reaction I'll have the chlorine process and in the second half reaction I'll have the iodine process there so in the first one we have the chlorate ion that's being turned into the chloride ion now please remember that the first step is balance everything except for hydrogen and oxygen well that's already balanced we have one chlorine on both sides so we can jump right ahead to balancing the oxygens we have three oxygens over here we don't have any over here to balance that I need to have three water molecules right on the right side here now to balance my hydrogen I thought I just added I have 3 times 2 which is six so I have to add 6h plus ions to the left side right just like this so now I'm ready to balance my charge so if I look at the charge I have a total charge of plus 5 on the left side plus 6 right here and a minus 1 so that's a positive five and on the right side there's a negative one total right here so the difference between a positive 5 and a negative 1 would be six so I need to add six electrons to the left side right here now on the second half reaction I want to start by balancing the iodine atoms so I have two iodine atoms here only one right there so if I stick a 2 right there now my iodines are balanced let's take a look at the oxygens I have six oxygens right here three times two and so to balance out the oxygens I need to add six water molecules to the left side just like this so now the oxygens are good next I want to look at the hydrogen ions so I have 6 times 2 which is 12 so I need to add 12 hydrogen ions over to the right side and now I'm ready to look at my charge on the left side everything is neutral it seems so that's a zero but over here on the right side I have there's a plus 12 right there and negative 2 so that's a a charge of plus 10. so 0 versus plus 10 means I need to place 10 electrons in this position on the right side right here so now I'm ready to add these together we look at the first one we see this as a reduction since we're gaining electrons and we're losing electrons in the second one so that's an oxidation so now as we add these together you might notice that first of all we need to make these electrons disappear because six electrons here and 10 electrons there will not cancel out so in order to make this work it looks like I'm going to need to multiply the first half reaction by five to to bump those electrons up to 30 and I'm going to have to multiply the second half reaction by 3 in order to make that work so now those electrons are going to disappear you might notice that there are some other things that are going to cancel out when I add these together I can cancel out 15 water molecules on both sides that brings this down to three and I can I can also cancel out 30 hydrogen ions on both sides so this will go away and it will leave six hydrogen ions over here so when I write the overall balanced equation this is what it's going to look like once everything that can be canceled out has been canceled out so this one was a little bit more complex just because of so much more that was going on now is there any way that we can make this even more complex well there is one way we can actually take a look at a basic solution now and these other two examples we've had these redox reactions that take place in acidic solution it seems like most redox reactions do take place in acidic solution but sometimes they take place in basic Solutions so how do you solve that well let me show you it's actually pretty much the same as it was before just a little step that we have to add in at the end so once again I'm going to separate these into two logical half reactions I have the manganese half reaction in the first one and I've put the carbon and nitrogen in the second one so in half reaction number one the manganese atoms are balanced but the oxygen atoms are not so I'm going to balance the the four versus two by adding two water molecules to the right side so that balances the oxygens next I have four hydrogens versus zero on the left side so I'm going to add four h pluses on the left side now some of you might be thinking well you know if it's in basic solution we can't really have hydrogen ions in a very large amount can't wait well we're going to fix that here at the end so just kind of kind of sit tight on on this here so let's balance the charge now we have a positive 4 and a negative one so that's that's positive 3 on the left side versus a charge of zero on the right side so to get the charge all balanced I need three electrons over here just like that so that makes this first half reaction balanced now the second half reaction I have the carbons and nitrogens balanced but the oxygens are not I have one on the right side so I need to add one water molecule on the left side to balance out my oxygens so now I can balance these two hydrogen atoms in the Water by placing two hydrogen ions on the right side just like this so now I'm ready to look at my charge on the left side I have a total charge of negative one and on the right side I have a positive 2 and a negative 1 so that is a positive one so negative 1 versus positive one means I need to place two electrons right here so once again I'm gaining electrons in this half reaction so this is going to be a reduction and I'm losing electrons here so that's going to be an oxidation so now I'm ready to add these together as you can see my electrons do not disappear so I need to multiply half reaction number one by a 2 like this because I double all the coefficients and then in the second half reaction I need to Triple all the coefficients like this so now my six electrons will cancel out and you might notice that three water molecules will cancel out as well with three of those bumping this down to one water molecule and I noticed that six hydrogen ions will cancel out on both sides so this will go away and I'll be left with two hydrogen ions right here so this is my overall balanced equation at this point now like I said since this is in a basic solution I can't just leave these two hydrogen ions sitting around here because you're not going to have a whole lot of hydrogen ions in a basic solution so to take care of that I'm going to counteract this by adding two hydroxide ions right there now whenever you add something to a certain side of an equation like an algebra for example you have to add the same thing to the other side of the equation so I'm going to add two hydroxide ions to the right side just like this so I can counteract that so now when I add these together I need to realize that the two hydrogen and the two hydroxide ions are going into are going to turn into two water molecules so I can actually mark this out and write that as two water molecules and this water molecule right here is going to cancel out with one of those right there leaving me with just one water molecule so now when I get my overall balanced equation this is what it's going to look like a little bit more complicated isn't it it would be unusual that they would ask you to do something like this on an AP exam but this is something that you are expected to do in general chemistry so this is an important skill to be able to do if you're moving forward in chemistry hope you learned something from this rather lengthy video about balancing complicated redox reactions if you did please shoot me a thumbs up and this actually brings us to the end of unit four so I hope to see you in my next video in which we're going to start unit 5 and jump into the rates of reaction chemical kinetics thanks for watching,"2,263",0,50
"Reaction Rates & Introduction to Kinetics - AP Chem Unit 5, Topic 1","In this video, Mr. Krug gives students an introduction to chemical kinetics and discusses how reaction rates are calculated.  He works several example problems throughout the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDV_qaFCARA&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=51,unit 5 section one gives us an introduction to the fundamentals of chemical kinetics now this unit unit five is going to be the first in a series of units that talks about different facets of chemical reactions for example here in a future unit we'll talk about thermodynamics which answers the question will the reaction take place is it going to go and if it does well how much heat is associated with that reaction we'll also talk about equilibrium here in a future section and that answers the question how far will the reaction go is the reaction going to precede 100% of the way to completion is only going to go halfway a third of the way how far is it going to go well unit five is about kinetics and this answers the question how fast will the reaction go so when we talk about chemical kinetics we're specifically studying the rates of chemical reactions and the factors that affect those rates of reaction so as you're probably aware there's some chemical reactions that take place very quickly as you can see in the picture here here's a picture of something that seems to be on fire almost uh explosively a very very fast reaction and there are some reactions that we're going to study in this unit that react very quickly pretty much that fast on the other hand there are some reactions that take Place very slowly like we see in this picture like you have with the rusting of a car and yes we are going to talk about those or some of those types of reactions as well and how we can describe those very slow rates of reaction now before we jump into this though it's probably good for us to learn about some of the definitions and and how we actually measure and talk about the rate of reaction so we're going to look at this balanced equation here we have 2 n22 and it decomposes into 2 n2o and O2 so we're going to take a look at a graph and as we do that we're going to focus on the reactant which is the D nitrogen dioxide and we're also going to focus on just the D nitrogen monoxide product right now we're going to ignore the oxygen we'll we'll come back to that a little bit later so let's take a look at this graph now this graph is a graph of concentration as a function of time and so notice that the product n2o starts out with a concentration of zero which you would expect since it's a product you're not going to have too much of that product starting out and then as the reaction proceeds its concentration increases and notice that the reactant n22 starts out at a fairly High concentration looks like it's about 1.700 moles per liter and then it goes down as time goes on and that's what you would expect as well for a reactant that it would start out with a relatively High concentration and slowly drop as time goes on now what do you notice about the rates of both of those substances well one thing that may seem a bit peculiar about the graph is that both of the curves pretty much look the same in fact the only difference is they're going in opposite directions essentially the n2o goes up at pretty much the same rate at which the n202 goes down but they're just opposite in direction now is that a coincidence well I don't think so because if we take a look at the balanced equation and we look at the coefficients of those substances notice that the coefficient of n2o which is a two is the same as the coefficient for n22 it's also a two these are equal coefficients this tells us something about the rates whenever you have substances in a balanced equation that have the same coefficient they're going to have the same rate of reaction now the only difference is if it's a product well it's going to go up at that rate and if it's a reactant it's going to go down at that same rate so the balanced equation can tell us some things about the relative rates of reaction now let's take a look at this graph again and let's just notice or focus in on how the rate of reaction changes as time progresses I want you to notice that for both of these substances and it doesn't really matter which one we focus on notice that at the beginning of the reaction in the case of n2o anyway it shoots up fairly quickly and then with every interval after it it shoots up slower and slower and slower so we notice that at the beginning of the reaction the rate is the highest and then as time goes on the rate goes down now mathematically speaking you can take a look at this and say that the slope of the line or I should say the the absolute value of the slope of the line is the highest at the beginning of the reaction that's the case for the the reactant as well it drops the most quickly at the beginning of the reaction and then likewise in every interval it slows down after that now let's actually put some numbers to this let's determine the rate of change of n2o in the time interval from 0 to 50 seconds so we're going to take a look at the n2o curve that's this one here from 0 to 50 seconds now when we measure the rate of a reaction it's a little different than the rate of a car or rate of a of an airplane or something like that because the rate of a car for example is the change in distance divided by the change in time well when you have a chemical reaction you don't have a beaker that's literally like sliding across the table that's not what we're talking about when we're talking about rate we're discussing the change in the concentration of the substance over change in time now that's a lot easier to calculate isn't it for n2o all we have is notice that it went from uh basically from 0. up to 0.500 over the the course of the first 50 seconds over here so the way that we calculate that is just 050 molar minus 0 molar divided by 50 seconds and so when you key that uh those numbers into your calculator you should get an answer of about 1.00 * 102nd a marity per second now you want to have units whenever you talk about the rate of change or the rate of reaction the unit in a kinetics problem like this should be some sort of concentration unit divided by a unit of time in this case we're using marity so I use marity per second If This Were a slower reaction it might be marity per minutes or marity per hour or marity per Century who knows but either way it should be some sort of concentration unit divided by time time now as you can probably tell if we just look over the entire 50c interval that's probably not the most precise way to determine the rate at the beginning of that reaction because we can probably figure out that at the beginning of the 50 seconds it's going faster and then by the time we get to the end of the 50 seconds it has probably slowed down a little bit so if you want to use a more precise way of determining the instantaneous rate that is the rate at a specific Moment In Time the way that you would do that is you would take the slope of a tangent line to that curve so what that means is let's say let's just say for example that you wanted to find the uh the rate or the instantaneous rate at oh let's say 75 seconds and so what you would do is you would in the case of n2o you'd pinpoint 75 seconds which is right here as far as I can tell and then you would draw a tangent line to the curve and that's a little bit hard for me to do here on the screen but a tangent line is just a a line that touches that curve at exactly that one point and that I'm not doing a very good job drawing a tangent line but that's the basic idea there that's the tangent line at 75 seconds and you'd find the slope of that line and the absolute value of that slope is going to be the the instantaneous rate at that particular moment in time and you could do that for any time period if you wanted to to take a look at say 300 seconds well you would do the essentially the the same thing you take the curve at 300 seconds right there which is right around that spot right there and you would draw a tangent line and I'm once again not very good at this on the screen but you get the I well I like I'm following the the curve so you get the idea there we're going to draw a tangent line and we'd have to find the slope of that you can probably eyeball that and see that the slope is less so the rate is going to be lower as you proceed uh farther in time that's how you would do that let's try another example we just decided or just calculated that the rate of change of n2o in the time interval from 0 to 5050 seconds was 1.00 time 102 a marity per second so if that's the case let's estimate the rate of change of oxygen over the same time interval now we're going to use what we mentioned earlier and that would be the coefficients so notice that the mole ratio of n2o to oxygen is 2 to one so that tells us that whatever the rate of reaction of n2o is going to be oxygen is going to be half of that because its coefficient is half that of n2o so all we have to do to answer the question is figure out whatever half of 1 * 10 -2 marity per second is and so that would be 5.0 * 10 -3rd marity per second and so that's all you would have to do for something like this now let's try a different question let's estimate the rate of change for n202 over that same 50-second time interval well notice that this time the coefficients are the same it's a 2 to2 ratio so whatever the the the rate of n2o was guess what n2o or n22 is going to be the same so it would also be 1.0 time 10 -2 marity per second and so you can use the coefficients of of the balanced equation as a ratio to determine the relative rates of reaction of the different substances now just so you know you might notice that all the rates that we've looked at so far are positive values sometimes I know in physics they say if you're going uh if if the value is increasing we say the rate is positive and if it's uh going backwards we say the rate is negative that's not the case here in chemistry we don't worry about that just just by convention we say that all rates are positive so we wouldn't say that this is a negative rate or anything like that it's like in your car speedometer if you uh if you put it into reverse and you start driving you're still proceeding at a positive rate we're not going to worry about the negative rate no one's going to say you're going a negative 50 kilometers per hour that's not really how it works now let's wrap up this first section by talking about four ways to speed up a chemical reaction now usually when we're in the lab we are thinking about making a reaction go faster well likewise if you were to do the opposite of things you would slow down the reaction so these are the four factors that affect the rate the first way is to change the temperature now we know this works because when you raise the temperature you're causing the molecules to move faster and when molecules move faster they're going to collide more often and when they do Collide they're going to collide with more force and so that's one of the uh key in fact probably the easiest way to make a reaction go faster is to raise the temperature um generally in in Industry we have little rule of thumb that says approximately for every 10 10° C that you increase the temperature it causes the rate of at typical reaction to double and that's not the case all the time but that's just a rule of thumb that sometimes we we think about but think about how that works on a molecular level you know faster molecules more collisions and they react with more force or they collide with more Force so you have a better chance of an effective Collision that's going to create a chemical reaction another thing that you can do is increase the concentration we'll talk more about this in an upcoming video now when you increase the concentration what you're uh doing is you're causing the uh the molecules that are potentially going to react to be packed closer to each other so instead of being you know farther apart and they Collide less frequently when they're smashed closer to each other they're going to collide more frequently so you'll have a better chance of a faster chemical reaction now this would be the case in a solution increasing the concentration if we're talking about gases we would normally say increase the pressure wouldn't we increasing the pressure of a gas is going to have the same effect as increasing the concentration of a solution it's really the same thing we just call it something different now a third way to speed up a reaction is to decrease the particle size now I think fundamentally or intuitively most of us understand this if you take a log a fairly large log and you try to put that into a fireplace it's going to take a a certain amount of time for that log to burn maybe an hour or two hours I don't know if you take that same log and you run that through a wood chipper and now you have the same amount of wood but now it's the size of wood chips it's going to burn much faster maybe in 10 or 15 minutes if you take those wood chips and pulverize it down to the consistency of sawdust now that same amount of wood is going to react or burn much more quickly perhaps in just a perhaps a minute or so if you could somehow take that and get the particle size fine enough it could actually cause an explosion ion and that is something that happens sometimes if you have grain or perhaps other particles that are very very fine very very small particles it can actually cause an explosion now the reason this works is that if you decrease the particle size it causes the reactant to have a greater surface area and so there are literally more spots on the reactants where a reaction can occur now in chemistry we say that that increases the number of active sites that's just a fancy way of saying you have more spots or more places where a chemical reaction can take place so decreasing particle size you know increasing the surface area it's a very effective way to speed up a reaction now let's take a look at the fourth way which is po possibly the first way that some of you might have been thinking about and that's to add a catalyst now we'll talk more about catalysts later on in this unit but a catalyst is pretty neat because it speeds up a reaction without being consumed and so it's this is something that almost seems too good to be true you put a catalyst into a reaction it speeds up the reaction but it it never gets used up and so you can keep recycling it over and over which is one of the the neat things about using a catalyst now the way this works is a catalyst will lower the activation energy of reaction we'll talk more about what that means here in an upcoming U video but essentially what's happening is catalysts provide a lower energy alternate pathway for the reaction and when you have a lower energy pathway that means more molecules are going to be able to attain that lower energy maybe the uncatalyzed reaction would have had a very high energy threshold in order to react and maybe not many molecules would be able to attain that threshold well since you have a lower energy alternate pathway a whole lot of molecules will be able to attain that and that's going to cause the reaction to go faster so these are the four ways that you need to know about to speed up a reaction raise the temperature raise the concentration that's kind of the same thing as increasing the pressure decrease the particle size and add a catalyst I hope you've learned something about the fundamentals of chemical kinetics hope you smash that Thumbs Up Button my name is Jeremy Krug and I hope to see you in my

I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're covering unit five section two of AP Chemistry which is about rate laws and how we write those now a rate law is a special equation that helps us understand how the rate of a specific chemical reaction is going to take place now as you can see here on the screen in order to write a rate law we have to have some experimental data we can't just look at a balanced equation and use that to write a rate law that's that's not enough we have to have a a set of data so here's an example of a balanced equation and here we have some data we have three different experiments and in each one of these three experiments we have an initial concentration of each reactant so for example in experiment one our initial concentration of cl2 would be 020 moles per liter and for hydroxide ion it's 03 0 moles per liter and the initial rate of the reaction is 00276 marity per second and then we have these other two experiments as well so if we want to find the order of the reaction with respect to chlorine dioxide what we have to do is find two experiments where chlorine dioxide is the only concentration that's changing now I'm going to focus on experiments one and two and I'm going to do that because notice that the hydroxide concentration was held constant from experiment 1 to experiment two while the concentration of chlorine dioxide was tripled so I'm going to focus on experiments one and two now as I do that if I look at the rate what happened to the initial rate from experiment one to experiment two well if I put this in my calculator I find out that it actually went up by a factor of nine this number right here is nine times larger than that one and that's just a simple calculation so I can use this data to determine the order of the reaction with respect to chlorine dioxide if the chlorine dioxide went up by a factor of three and the rate went up by a factor of nine what is the power that makes that a true statement well it's two and so that means that the order of the reaction with respect to chlorine dioxide is second order that's how that works now if we want to find out what is the order of the reaction with respect to hydroxide we have to do the same thing except with hydroxide so let's find two experiments where hydroxide is the only uh re reactant that's being changed now I could choose two and three but that's not going to work because hydroxide is changing and chlorine dioxide is changing and I don't want to do that so let's do one and three I think that's the best choice because hydroxide is being tripled from experiment 1 to experiment 3 while chlorine dioxide is being held constant so that's a good choice one to three now how is the rate changing from experiment 1 to experiment 3 well I can possibly just eyeball that or I could divide it on my calculator and I can see that this number here 828 is three times that number right there 00276 so let's think about how that works if I'm tripling the concentration of hydroxide and I'm tripling the rate what is the power that's going to make that a true statement well it's a one isn't it 3 to the first power is three so that tells me that the order of the reaction with respect to hydroxide is first order now notice you could not have predicted that just by looking at the overall balanced equation now let's use this information to write the rate law for this reaction now the rate law has to be written in a very specific way it's always written in this format rate equals K time the concentration of the first reactant raised to its power which in this case is chlorine dioxide to the second power times the next uh reactant raised to its order raised to its power which is hydroxide raised to the first power so this is the rate law all we have to do is write rate equals K and then Sub in these other reactants raised to whatever order we happened to determine them to be so there we have the rate law and it's not hard to do you just have to remember to use the right format now what is the overall order of this reaction well the overall order is just the sum of the individual orders so basically just take these Powers here and add them together 2 + 1 gets us a total of three so this is overall going to be third order if you know the individual orders just add them together and that's your overall order now let's take this one step further K that we wrote in the rate law there that's actually called the rate constant now let's calculate the numerical value of the rate constant for the reaction at this temperature and of course we have to use correct units now the way we do that is we actually take the rate law that we just wrote and we plug and chug the numbers from any one of these three experiments now it doesn't matter which experiment we use if we're doing our work correctly the rate constant should be the same no matter which experiment you use I'm going to use experiment one just CU it's it's there so I'm going to plug it in here the rate for experiment one was 00276 marity per second and we're solving for K the cl2 was .02 2 molar and that's squared cuz it's second order and then times 030 molar I just divide basically use algebra to divide 0.276 by 0.02 squared and then divide by .03 and I get an answer of 230 now the number is probably pretty easy to calculate the units are a little bit trickier so I want to show you how we get those now I want you to notice that whenever we're solving for K we have to isolate that variable so we have a marity squared time marity right here so hope you realize that's marity cubed so in order to isolate that variable we have to multiply this by one over marity cubed and in algebra if you do something to one side of the equation you have to do it to the other side of the equation as well so I have to multiply this Side by 1 over marity cubed now of course these three Mari here cancel out with that right there on the left side though this marity cancel cancels out with only one of those three so that's why it's 1 over marity squared time seconds once again in order to get this part of the question right you have to be very careful with how you work your units now let's try another another example here we're going to use this reaction it's the same type of problem we've just changing the numbers and the equation so let's find the order of the reaction with respect to n o so once again we're looking for two experiments where no o is the only reactant that's changing concentration and I would pinpoint experiments one and two for that because n o seems to be doubling now bromine is the same it's constant but what's happening to the rate from 1 to two well if you take a calculator or just take a look at that hopefully you can see that the rate is actually quadrupling it's going up by factor of four so what is the order if we have a case here where the concentration is doubling and the rate goes up by a factor of four do you see what the order of that is it's second order isn't it so this is a a second order process with regard to n o let's try the same thing but with bromine this time so let's find a couple of experiments that work for Bromine now I would say one and three seem to be the best because in that one bromine is doubling but no o is constant in experiment one to experiment 3 so what's happening to the rate from experiment one to Experiment three well let's think about it seems to be a doubling so if we double the concentration and we double the rate then that means our order is going to be first order so bromine is going to be first order here now that's the rate law isn't it we just take rate equals K time n o and it's second order so that's why there's a little two there and then times br2 and we don't have to write an an exponent there there since it's first order now let's take this one step further what is the overall order well it's the sum of the individual orders isn't it so 2 + 1 would be third order now let's calculate the rate constant with the uh correct units this time so once again we're going to use that very same equation the rate law that we just wrote and we're going to plug in the numbers now doesn't matter which experiment you use you're welcome to use any one of the those three experiments I'm going to use experiment one so the rate in that uh experiment is 1.4 * 10 the -3rd mity per second and of course we're solving for k n o in that experiment was 02 moles per liter that's got to be squared since it's second order and then bromine was3 moles per liter so I solve for k mathematically and I get about 120 and I solve for the units the same way I did before on the right side I have to multiply by 1 over marity cubed and then I do the same thing on the other side and I should get these same units 120 um one over marity squared seconds or if you put it all in the numerator it's marity to Theus 2 seconds to theus1 I hope you learned something about rate laws if you were able to follow this please shoot me a thumbs up there hope you're able to write rate laws and determine orders and rate Constance as you go forward in this kinetic section join me in my next video we're going to uh find another way to determine the order with respect to a reactant thanks for watching,"6,816",0,52
"Concentration Changes Over Time - AP Chem Unit 5, Topic 3","In this video, Mr. Krug shows how to determine the order of a reaction with respect to a reactant graphically.  He also introduces integrated rate laws and works several examples with these important equations.  He introduces and derives the first-order half-life equation and shows how this equation can be used.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jln8OrpjEsA&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=53,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this section we're going to be taking a look at integrated rate laws which give us another tool in order to determine the order of a reaction with respect to a certain reactant now in our last video we learned about how you can essentially take two or three or four different experiments and use those multiple experiments to determine the order well in this method all we have to do is actually have one experiment now what you want to do is take the reactant that you're trying to determine the order of and let's make some graphs the first graph we're going to make is the concentration of the reactant on the Y AIS and time on the x- axis and so if you do that there's a chance that the graph might look something like this if you find that that plot is a straight line like we have right here that means the reaction is zeroth order now we haven't talked much about that but essentially what that means is the concentration just decreases steadily over time it doesn't really have any other factor that is affecting it now if that's the case then the rate law is going to be rate equals K times the reactant raised to the zero power now you probably know that anything raised to the zero power is just equal to one which means rate equals K and so the rate is just whatever the rate constant is now if that's the case you'll find that the rate constant K is equal to whatever the absolute value of the slope of that line is so in simple algebra you probably have learned how to determine the slope of a line rise over run so you could just calculate that just graphically and then take the absolute value of that and that would be your rate constant now notice the word here if I said if the plot is a straight line that means there's a good chance it's not going to be a straight line now that's the case then let's make another graph the next graph that you would want to make is a plot of the natural logarithm of concentration of the reactant versus time so you make another graph so natural log of the of the reactant would be plotted on the X on the y- AIS rather and time is plotted on the x- axis and if that graph gives you a straight line then the reaction is first order and if just going to be rate equals K times the reactant raised to the first power so rate equals K time the reactant a in this case and if you want to find the uh rate constant well same way as you did it the other time it was a straight line just take the slope of the straight line rise over run and then take the absolute value of that slope and that's going to be the rate constant now once again we have that word if in here again that means there's a pretty good chance that this is not going to be a straight line either so if that's the case well then you have to make yet another graph a third graph and in this one you're going to make a graph of the reciprocal of concentration of the reactant versus time so basically 1 over a versus time and if you do that and the graph looks like this and it's a nice straight line then we say the reaction is second order so we have three possible graphs that you could make uh concentration versus time natural log of concentration versus time reciprocal of concentration versus time only one of those is going to be a straight line if this one's a straight line it's second order now if that's the case then the rate law is going to be rate equals K * a to the 2 power you know that two is there because it's second order and the rate constant is determined the same way as it was in the other ones it's just take the slope of the line and since it's a positive slope the rate constant is just equal to the slope of the line now to keep things consistent I wrote It's equal to the absolute value of the slope of the line because that's true that's mathematically correct just just to keep it consistent among zero first and second order but since it's positive K is just equal to the slope and so you can determine the order of a reactant in a reaction just by doing this graphically now let's try an example problem here here we have a reaction 22 yields N2 + 202 is studied the following graphs are produced and used to analyze the reaction so part A asks what is the order of this reaction with respect to NO2 now we have these three graphs we want to look for the straight line graph do you see the straight line it's the third graph isn't it this one right here and the straight line is the one one over NO2 now do you remember the reciprocal one over the concentration versus time what order does that mean well that was second order wasn't it so this is a second order process whenever you're thinking about these concentration if that had been a straight line this one over here it would have been zero order natural log that's like secret code for first order so if this graph had had been a straight line it would have been first order one over concentration that is secret code for second order so since this is a straight line it's a second order graph you have to know that the College Board does not tell you that information on the AP exam so you have to be able to to keep all this straight now let's write the rate law well there's only one reactant this is pretty straightforward rate equals k time NO2 and since it's second order it's squared so put that little squared up there now this is how we determine the order of something graphically now we're going to take this uh one step further and we're going to do part C and let's determine the rate constant for this reaction with appropriate units so now to do this we have to find the slope of that line now this is kind of an inexact science since we have uh you know it's it's graph of we're just we'll just just do our best here and I'm going to use these first two points right here we have a point right here a point right here I would say that this point right here is at the ordered pair looks like it's about 60 comma 150 and this point right here is at the ordered pair 0 comma 100 so all I have to do is take rise over run so the Y's that's 50 and my units are mity the minus one over the change in X which is 60 - 0 that's 60 and my units on the x axis are seconds and so when I divide this out 50 divided 60 I believe is about 0.83 and that's marity to the minus1 if I bring the seconds to the numerator it becomes seconds to the minus one as well so there I have the ray constant just the slope don't forget to put the units in there as well now let's take this yet a step further we're going to look at a special type of equation that's actually going to help us to uh calculate how much of a reactant is present after a certain amount of time and this is something called an integrated rate law we can actually use these and this is this is actually very neat we can calculate the concentration at any time throughout the reaction now if we have a first order process you know rate equals K * a we can use calculus and integrate this this this equation here into something that looks like this natural log of a sub T minus natural log of a Sub 0 equals negative KT now you don't have to know the calculus that's the nice part about this if you take a physical chemistry in college you'll see how this works but for right now just take take my word for it that that is the first order integrated rate law now a subt represents the concentration of a reactant a at time T after how many you know T seconds or t minutes have gone by a Subzero represents the concentration at time zero and that's just an arbitrary time that could be the time that you uh start the reaction it could be some other time it could be at the point when you start your stopwatch it's just the starting time now K that's the rate constant we've worked with that a little bit already in this unit and then T is the time that has elapsed so we're going to solve a couple problems with this first order integrated rate law and let's see how we can do that so A first order reaction has a rate constant of 3.8 * 10us second reciprocal seconds at 270 Kelvin if the reactant begins with a concentration of 0.5 molar what will be the concentration after 60 seconds so once again we're going to use the first order integrator rate law and we're just going to plug and chug now notice we're trying to find the concentration after 60 seconds have elapsed so we're solving for a subt so that's our unknown in this equation now as Sub Zero that's the concentration at the beginning now that's why there's this little zero there so what's the concentration at the beginning well it says it's 050 so I'm going to plug that in there now the rate constant the K is given to us 3.8 * 10 -2 and the T is for time it says after 60 seconds we're going to plug the 60 in there so now all we have to do is use algebra to solve for a subt so on the right side using my calculator I get - 2.28 the natural log of 0.5 is. 693 be very careful with your signs here because we have a minus a negative so that's actually a positive so when I subtract 693 from both sides I get natural log of a subt equals about -2. 973 and so now all I have to do is take the uh inverse natural log of negative 2973 on your calculator there is an e to the x button probably it's on the second natural log button so just click that and if you evaluate this you'll find that a subt T is about 0.051 molar and so that's the answer and that makes sense because if we're starting out at 050 molar you'd expect the concentration after 60 seconds to be somewhat less than that so this is an answer that does make sense if you're doing these problems and you ever get a concentration that's a negative number well that doesn't make sense that's not possible so you know that you had done something wrong if that were the case or if the concentration were you know higher than 0.50 reactants shouldn't uh shouldn't do that let's try another example here A first order process at 300 Kelvin is measured if the reactants concentration drops from .95 molar to .45 molar in 170 seconds what is the rate constant so now we're going to use that same first order integrated rate law we're going to plug and chug again so a subt that's the uh the ending concentration so that's 045 we'll plug that in and then the a Sub 0 is my starting concentration so that's 0.95 and the K is what we're solving for this time so that's my unknown the time is 170 seconds so now I can just use my calculator and algebra of course to solve for K so natural log of .45 is. 799 natural log of .95 is 0513 and then I have the right side over here I'm going to evaluate all this on the left side that's negative. 7477 and on the right side I still have my - 170 K so when I solve for K I get an answer of 4.4 * 10 -3rd reciprocal seconds so that's how I solve this this problem here using the integrated rate law now another very important uh function as far as determining how much of something is left and how long it takes for it to to Decay is called the half-life and this is especially very important for first order processes now an important first order process that takes place in the natural world is nuclear Decay and probably when you hear the word halflife or the pH halflife you're probably going to think of nuclear Decay and for these first order processes we're often interested in how long it takes for half of an initial reactant to be depleted and the time it takes for exactly half of a reactant to be depleted is called the halflife now we're going to derive that equation for halflife and we're going to start with the integrated rate law for first order now in this video course I don't derive a whole lot of equations this is one of just a couple that I actually derive in the whole hundred and some odd video uh Series so I think this is kind of Fairly important and fairly interesting now hopefully you'll agree that at the halflife a subt is just equal to whatever you started with you know a sub zero divided by two right so if that's the case then this is also a true statement that the natural log of a Sub 0 / 2 is the same thing as natural log of a t at the half life isn't it so I'm going to just plug that in there and everything else is the same and since we're talking about halflife I've just substituted in a little abbreviation for halflife we'll call that t sub one2 now at this point there is a um there is a property of logarithms that says log of x / Y is equal to log x minus log y so I'm going to carry that out with this little division over here natural log of a Sub 0 / 2 is equal to natural log of a Sub 0 minus natural log of 2 and of course the rest of that equation is intact now you might notice that we have natural log of a Sub 0 Min us natural log of a Sub 0 so I can actually cancel those out and I can do a little sign change here and what I'm left with is the natural log of the number two equals the rate constant times the halflife and so if I'm interested in the halflife I just divide both sides by K and figure out what natural log of two is on my calculator and I can find out that the halflife for any first order process is equal to the number 693 ided K and that's my halflife equation pretty neat little equation hopefully you can see how we get that now now we're going to use that equation to solve a half-life problem in the previous problem the first order reaction had a rate constant of 4.4 * 10 the 3 reciprocal seconds what is the half life of this process in seconds well if we know the rayon constant all we've got to do is plug it into that equation right there so plug it in and if you take 693 divided by 4.4 * 10 3r reciprocal seconds you find that the halflife is equal to 158 seconds so you know just over you know 2 and a half minutes approximately so there we have the halflife now we've been looking at the first order integrated rate loss and of course a half-life equation derived from that well we're going to look at the second order integrated rate law as well now this is what that looks like 1 over a sub T minus 1/ a Sub 0 equals KT so we just use this for second order processes and once again this is just a plug-and chug just like it was for first order let's try this example a second order process C has a rate constant of 2.6 * 102 reciprocal marity reciprocal seconds if reactant a has an initial concentration of 080 molar how long will it take for its concentration to drop to10 molar so once again we're just going to plug and chug into the equation here the a subt is the final concentration right so that's the 0.10 so we're going to plug that in for a subt and the starting concentration is a Sub 0 which is 80 molar so I'm going to plug that in for a sub 0 it tells me what the rate constant is the K is 2.6 * 102 so I'm going to plug that in there and of course I'm solving for T so now I just have to you know solve on my calculator and using algebra so the reciprocal of 0.1 is 10 10 and then the reciprocal of 80 is 1.25 so I have this when I subtract that out I get 8.75 = 2.6 * 10- 2nd * T and when I divide this out I find that the answer for T is about 337 seconds and so that's my answer that's how long it's going to take for this concentration to drop by that amount so that's how we work a problem with a second order integrated rate law uh there is even a zero order integrated rate law but if you can work with uh first and second working with zero order is very simple in fact here's just a very brief summary of everything we've looked at in this section about integrated rate laws for zero order there's your rate law there are your units for K if you ever had to use the integrated rate law for zero order that's what it is it's actually very straight forward just uh plug and chug here's your first order information rate law units for K integrated rate law and there it is for second order so you know these these integrated rate laws are just plugging it in using Algebra I think that that's something that most AP Chemistry students can do especially if they're given those equations which they will be given those on the AP exam thanks for watching hope you learned something here this is kind of a long video but there's a lot going on here with this section if you learn something please hit that

"How Reactions Happen: Steps, Collisions, & Energy - AP Chem Unit 5, Topics 4, 5, and 6","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses the intricacies of HOW chemical reactions take place.  He starts out with the concept of elementary steps and multi-step processes, then he continues with the collision model of how reactions take place.  Then the video concludes with how energy changes over the course of a reaction, highlighting the difference between exothermic and endothermic processes. 00:00 - Topic 5.4 Elementary Reactions 04:55 -

video we're going to continue our discussion of kinetics and we're going to combine sections four five and six of unit five and we're going to talk about how chemical reactions take place now very often we're going to find that a lot of chemical reactions aren't just going to take place in one big step as it turns out a lot in fact possibly most chemical reactions take place in multiple little steps or as we sometimes call them Elementary steps and we have an example of that here on this slide where we have uh two steps where we have n2o that yields n2+ o and then we have n2o plus o yields N2 + O2 and those are two steps that add up to give us one overall chemical reaction now each of those two steps can be described with its own little miniature rate law so for example if we're going to look at the first step the way that we describe the rate of that step is just the rate of that step one equals K sub one which is the the rate constant for that first step times the concentration of n2o the way that we get this is we just look at the reactants and since the only reactant is n2o well that's the only thing that appears in the rate law for that step now likewise the rate law for step two is going to be rate for step two equals the rate constant for step two time n2o concentration time o concentration the n2o and the O are there because those are what you find in the reactant phase of that step and so in this case in these cases you can look at at the elementary step individual equation and write out the rate law for that individual step you can't do that for an overall balanced equation like we said back in the video for uh uh section two now if you want to find the overall balanced equation it's pretty simple just have to add these two uh equations together these two steps and we notice that there are usually a couple things that can be canceled out I see that the O can be canceled out in the right side and the left side right there just like an algebra equation and by the way anytime you see a substance that appears in an early step and is used up in a later step that's called a reaction intermediate and we'll talk more about that uh coming up because it is just an intermediate it doesn't really appear in the overall balanced equation so we have a total of 2 n2o gas yields 2 N2 2 gas plus O2 gas so this is the overall balanced equation we just add up those two Elementary steps to get the overall equation now if I were to ask you identify the bimolecular step in this reaction mechanism I hope you would identify step two and that's because we have two molecules those two molecules are n2o and O B molecular implies that there are two reactant molecules in in that Elementary step and if I were to ask identify the unimolecular step in the reaction mechanism I hope you'd identify step number one because step number one only has one molecule that essentially reacts with itself in order to make the the products for that step most of the time in these Elementary steps in these uh balanced equations here you're going to find unimolecular steps you're going to find bimolecular steps it's very unusual that you'll find a tur molecular step now a tur molecular step is a step that has three reactant molecules in it now the reason those are very rare is because in order for a ter molecular step to to exist you have to have three molecules that Collide in just the right orientation at the exact same time and that's quite unusual uh it's kind of like having three cars Collide on the highway at the exact same moment usually doesn't happen very rare in fact but bimolecular unimolecular you know two car collisions one car collisions those actually are fairly common termolecular not so much if it does exist it's probably going to be very slow and we'll see a couple of examples of that here later on now we're going to charge right on to unit five section five which helps us to understand how chemical reactions take place and how molecules collide with each other now in order to illustrate this we're going to just think about a very simple chemical reaction let's say we have H2 plus cl2 yields two molecules of HCL now if we think about this graphically we have here's a molecule of H2 and here's a molecule of cl2 and these molecules are just floating around they're kind of moving around in space and we know that every now and then these molecules are going to have to collide now most of the time these collisions are going to be you know perfectly elastic and so they just bounce off each other and keep going but every now and then we'll have a couple of these molecules that actually Collide into each other and if they have enough speed that means they are colliding with sufficient energy and if they're colliding with just the right orientation that means in the right direction not like backwards or anything like that they have just enough speed energy and the right orientation those two molecules will actually fuse so if this happens it's not going to work that's the wrong orientation but if it if it collides with the right orientation and enough energy the two molecules will actually fuse together and when that happens notice that we don't actually have two molecules of HCL we have one molecule of H2 cl2 and this is called the activated complex when these two molecules fuse together excuse me when I say activated complex I'm talking about a a transition state essentially it's not the reactant phase it's not the product phase it's something in the middle this is a a transition state this activated complex is an unstable uh high energy transition state molecule that's temporarily formed after the reactant state but before the product State and so we have this H2 cl2 now it's unstable like the definition says that means that this molecule is not going to exist for very long if it exists for a few Nan seconds that would be about it in most cases some of these bonds are going to have to break I think after learning about the molecular shape you know that hydrogen can't make two chemic bonds can it chlorine a chlorine atom honestly cannot make two chemical bonds the way it's configured like this so of the four bonds we see in the picture here two of those are going to have to break and if the two original bonds that were there break well we're going to make the product molecule so you see here we have two molecules of HCL there's one molecule there's the second molecule and so this idea behind how MO molecules Collide and how they have to have the right energy and the right orientation and then we have this activated complex this transition state and then things break apart this is a part of something that we call Collision Theory now when we think about the energy that's required to have a chemical reaction let's just go back to our Maxwell boltzman distribution curve now I think we've seen this before but let's use this distribution curve to help us think about how reactions take place now we have a sample and we've just changed the temperature so we have 100 Kelvin 200 kelv 500 Kelvin and 1,000 Kelvin and notice that as you increase the temperature we have more molecules that have a higher velocity so at 100 Kelvin almost all of your molecules are moving very slowly while at 1,000 Kelvin you have a whole lot of molecules that are moving very fast now let's imagine we have a just a typical hypothetical chemical reaction and it requires about 700 to 750 m/ second in order for the molecules to react that's the that's the threshold velocity for the molecules to react and create a chemical reaction like I said this is just theoretical we're just throwing out this this random value here do you see that if that's the threshold value how many of those molecules at 100 Kelvin are going to meet that threshold to be able to react well it sure looks like zero or if it's more than zero it's not much more than zero is it so at 100 Kelvin you'd have so few molecules reacting to make that that that desired uh product that the reaction would be extremely slow now how about at 200 Kelvin do you see see that we have a just a few molecules that meet that threshold velocity so you'd still have a very slow reaction but you'd have a little bit faster reaction but still very slow what about at 500 Kelvin well do you see that now at 500 Kelvin we have a significant number of the molecules that have the threshold velocity yeah so we have a much faster reaction at 500 Kelvin and at 1,000 Kelvin I bet you can see what would happen right we have a whole lot if not most of the molecules have reached the the threshold so we're going to have a much faster reaction at 1,000 Kelvin so this boltzman distribution curve kind of helps helps us to see how many molecules will have that threshold velocity and get over the over that transition state in order to make the products now we're going to move right into section six here and take a look at an energy profile diagram so uh have to excuse my uh crookedness here on the picture but this is just a very basic idea of how the energy of a reaction continues or moves or changes as it proceeds so here at the beginning notice that at the very beginning there's not much change it just kind of it's flat and that's what we call the energy of the reactants and then we see that the energy increases and it gets to a maximum a peak and then it starts to drop off fairly quickly and then eventually it levels off and it gets to the end well here in the Middle where you have that very high energy well that's our activated complex that we talked about that's a high energy unstable transition state so that's our activated complex that's the highest energy that we see on this profile now at the end I think it makes sense that that that would be your energy of your products so that's what you have at the end reactants at the at the beginning products at the end activated complex in the Middle with this very high energy unstable transition state now there are a couple of other uh features that we can point out on this graph we can point out the activation energy now notice that the activation energy is the distance from the starting point up to the peak now eventually or essentially activation energy is the amount of energy it takes to start a reaction so you've probably experienced this perhaps you've taken a match and you take a match and you just barely rub that on the box well it's not going to light is it you have to supply enough energy in order to make the the match light so if you strike that match with a lot of energy a lot of force then you've overcome the activation energy and now now you have a reaction so the activation energy is how much uh energy it requires to get things started and here at the end we have change in enthalpy now change in enthalpy is just the the difference between the starting point and the ending point so we'll talk quite a bit more about change in enthalpy in unit six but for right now that's our change in enthalpy now I want you to look at that graph can you determine if the reaction is exothermic or endothermic or in other words is this reaction releasing heat or is it absorbing heat well let's think about it this way we start out with this much heat and then the system ends up with less heat well if that's the case that means it must be releasing heat into the surroundings that means it is an EXO esmic process or if you want to you can think about it in terms of money imagine you walk into school one day with $100 in your pocket and then at the end of the school day you walk out of the school with $4 pocket what happened well you lost $60 right you lost it somehow maybe you bought a lot of lunch I don't know maybe you lost it maybe you bought something else or gave it away but somehow it was something that you lost right you lost the $60 same thing here if we start out with this many jewels let's say just say that it's 100 KJ and we end up with 40 kles well we're releasing we're losing that other 60 kles to the environment to the surroundings so that makes it an exothermic process in an endothermic process it's going to be the opposite where you start out with a low amount and end up with a higher value we'll see a couple of of examples with that later on in our uh in our course and of course how do you know well because you start with a higher amount and you end up with a lower amount that's what exothermic means and most reactions are exothermic now on this energy profile I have plotted something else on here I want you to note that I have a dotted blue line and this represents a catalyzed pathway so if we have just the original chemical reaction no Catalyst this is what it looks like before but then when we have a catalyst notice that it lowers a couple things it lowers the energy of the activated complex and likewise it lowers the activation energy doesn't it now let's think about this for a second why does lowering the activation energy speed up the reaction well let's think back to that the boltzman distribution that vertical red line imagine that we had shifted that to the left a little bit all of a sudden you have more molecules that are going to be able to have or obtain that threshold energy and react right what's the same deal here if you have a lower threshold to react you're going to have more molecules that qualify and you're going to have more molecules reacting and you're going to have a faster process and so that's what's going on here when we lower the activation energy by adding a catalyst then the reaction gets a whole lot faster now one other detail here why does the blue dotted line This catalyzed pathway have two for lack of a better term two humps well that's because when we have a catalyzed profile here or a catalyzed pathway each hump represents a separate step so maybe we have a two-step process now now let's take a look at one more detail when it comes to talking about reaction mechanisms and reaction profiles here let's imagine that we take a graph here and we're going to plot the natural log of the rate constant on the y axis and we're going to plot the reciprocal of the temperature in Kelvin on the x axis now we have the same this is one chemical reaction all we're doing is changing the temperature and measuring the rate constant as it changes and when you do that you have a plot that looks like this you should get a straight line well if you get that straight line the slope of that line is equal to negative activation energy over R where R is the universal gas constant 8.314 Jew per mole Kelvin now if you want to find out what the actual activation energy is this is a great way of doing it and this plot here is derived from something called the arenus equation now you might remember arenus from our discussion of acids and bases back in the last unit well this is the same arenus and here we have an equation where we can get this plot here so this is a nice uh relatively simple way to to determine the activation energy for a reaction you just have to get the uh the rate constant at different temperatures and then plot that on this graph here well hope you learned something about how chemical reactions take place if you did please slam that thumbs up button and I hope you join me in my next video where we're going to talk about reaction mechanisms and multi tstep processes and how we can figure out the uh the rate law from that information I'm Jeremy Krug thanks for

He gives an introduction to reaction mechanisms, show how reaction mechanisms relate to rate laws, how to perform a steady-state approximation, and how to work with a multistep energy profile.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6h2RlbW4Qg&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=55,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to learn about reaction mechanisms that is chemical reactions that take place in two or more steps and how we can analyze those multi-step processes so let's take a look at this reaction mechanism once again we see this process that takes place in two steps and let's start by writing the equation for the overall reaction so once again all you have to do is add these together just like they were algebra equations and we have a couple things we can cancel out we have an O on the left side which can cancel out with an O on the other side so when we cancel that out now we can add these together fairly simply and we get 2 n2o gas yields 2 N2 gas plus O2 gas so that's a fairly simple process there for writing the equation for your overall reaction now let's identify the reaction intermediate like we said in in in an earlier video the reaction intermediate is a substance that pops up in an early step and then it ends up being used up in a later step so the O is going to be the reaction intermediate now it's interesting that if we have these steps here and we know which one is the slow step we can also determine the rate law because you see in a chemical reaction the slow step step is the rate determining step I think that kind of makes sense intuitively uh if you're uh in a relay race and you have four runners and three of them are very fast but one of them is incredibly slow well you're going to be slowed down because of the slow person that you have on your team likewise those of you who drive a car know that if you're driving on a windy two-lane road and you're driving very fast but there's somebody in front of you who's driving very slow well the slow person is going to determine how fast you drive as well because you can only go as fast as the slow person in front of you so it's kind of the same way here a chemical reactions rate is determined by the slow step and so we're going to put some extra information in here we're going to go ahead and reveal that the first step is the slow step this is information that they would probably give you on an exam or an AP exam let's take that information and determine the rate law of that so all you have to do is look at the slow step and look at the reactant and that's it it's just rate equals K times the reactance of the slow step and that's it so it's just rate equals K times N20 and that's all you have to do so that seems pretty easy doesn't it well it is if the slow step is the first step but what happens if you have a case like this let's try this this problem let's use this mechanism to first of all write the overall equation for the reaction so once again we'll just add it up like we did before you might notice that we can cancel out this NO2 that's both on the right side in the first step and the left side in the second step and so now we can add this together we have 2 N gas plus cl2 gas yields 2 N CL gas and so that's our overall equation now Part B says determine the rate law of this reaction so let's take a look at the slow step since that's the rate determining step and we have two reactants in this step NO2 and n o so I guess that means that the rate law is rate equal K * NO2 times n right well that seems fine but if you if you start to look a little bit more closely do you see something wrong do you see a problem with this rate law do you notice that there's a substance in the rate law that doesn't appear in the overall balanced equation you know there's an NO2 here but there's no NO2 in the overall balanced equation this is a problem because if a substance doesn't appear in the overall balanced equation it can't be in the rate law someone's going to think that we don't know what we're talking about if we put something that's not in the equation into the rate law so what we have to do this is something called a steady state approximation you don't have to know that name or anything just know how to do it we're going to take the the rate law for the production of NO2 and plug it in in in place of NO2 so where was NO2 produced well that was in the first step there there is the there's the production of that so what's the rate law for its production well n * cl2 so I'm going to plug in no * cl2 in place of the NO2 right there and that's the raate law that's all you got to do now I do need to simplify this down because I have n o and an n o so it's actually rate equals K * N o^ squared time cl2 but that's all you have to do that's called a steady state approximation and this helps us to determine the rate law of a mechanism when the slow step is not the first step if the slow step is the first step it's easy isn't it there there are no intermediates to worry about but if it's the second step or a a later step that we have to to think about that little substitution in there now let's think about this in terms of our reaction profile that we looked at earlier in our last video now a multi-step reaction is going to have an energy profile with multiple humps just like you see here now the hump that rises the highest is the slowest step so that's the first step in this example the lower Peak is the faster step now since there are two steps we're going to have two transition States and it's going to be almost impossible to isolate either one remember transition States or activated complexes only exist for a few nanoseconds possibly uh the reaction intermediate is going to exist in this Valley down here and once the intermediate is formed it's going to be easier for it to form the products than the reactants since the activation energy for the forward second step in this direction is less than the activation energy for going backwards toward the reactants as you can see here so this helps us to see how this works for a multi-step process it is it is quite similar there are a couple details there that you need to know about I hope this video helped you learn about reaction mechanisms and how they work and how you can take a re action mechanism and write the rate law from that fairly simply in our next video we're going to talk about catalysts Hope you join me for that my name is Jeremy kug I've been teaching chemistry for a long time if you will give my video a thumbs up if you learn something I'd appreciate that and share this video with your AP Chemistry colleagues thanks for watching,"5,052",0,55
"Catalysis in Chemical Reactions - AP Chem Unit 5, Topic 11","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to recognize a catalyst in a reaction mechanism and how to work with a catalyst in a rate-determining step when writing a rate law.  He then finishes the video with some conceptual review questions about chemical kinetics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohwEQONchw&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=56,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this video we're going to be covering unit five section 11 which mainly covers catalysts and we're also going to use that to do some review on reaction mechanisms as well so let's take a look at this problem and we're going to pick up from where we left off in uh our last video using this mechanism we have a few questions to answer write the overall equation for the reaction identify the reaction intermediate identify the Catalyst and the the rate law of this reaction so let's take these two steps these two Elementary steps and add them together now the first thing you might want to notice is there are some things we have to cancel out we have this IO negative that needs to be cancelled out on both sides I also see an i negative that needs to be cancelled out and at that point I think we're able to add these these two steps together and get the overall equation so we have 2 H2O2 aquous yields two water Liquid Plus O2 so that's just like we did in the last video now Part B says Identify the reaction intermediate now remember the reaction intermediate is a substance that's produced in an early step and then it's used up in a later step so it's kind of like a it pops up and then it's used up so that would be the io negative ion so that is our intermediate now part C says Identify the Catalyst now we haven't talked much about how to identify catalysts in a mechanism yet but hopefully you can see what's going on here the catalyst is a molecule or an ion or some sort of a substance that's present both at the beginning of the reaction and at the end of the reaction but it's never actually consumed in fact we see that that is iodide so it's it's right here it's present at the beginning of the reaction and then it is also present at the end of the reaction over here and so it's never actually consumed or if you like to to to think of it this way it gets chewed up in the first step and then it gets spit out in the last step that's basically what happens to a catalyst it's it's it actually is participating in the reaction but it's not actually consumed so that is your Catalyst that's iodide so I'll be able to recognize the difference between a catalyst and a reaction intermediate in a mechanism like this now Part D says determine the rate law in our last video we talked about that and we said that we use the slow step to determine the rate law of the reaction so we just write rate equals K times the two substances in that slow step so there we go it's rate equals K * H2O2 time the iodide ion now do you see a problem with that rate law this is kind of like we had in the last video wasn't it you can't have a substance in the rate law that doesn't pop up or doesn't appear in the overall balanced equation and that includes catalysts we can't have intermediates in the rate law we can't have catalysts in the rate law either so guess what we have to do you're going to like this if you see a catalyst in the rate law all you have to do is make it go away it just disappears so that's kind of neat isn't it you just drop the Catalyst and so the rate law is now rate equals K time H2O2 so that's how you deal with a catalyst if it ever pops up in the rate law just uh obliterated I suppose just ignore it because it's not going to be part of the rate law now let's do a couple couple other uh practice questions to to wrap things up here for unit 5 we have a a mechanism this is a theoretical mechanism and part A says write the overall equation for this reaction so that's fairly simple we just have to add these together and we see that we can cancel out an AB right there we have a u looks like we have a an intermediate there we can also cancel out a B on both sides of the arrow and so that means when you add this together you have a plus b plus C yields AB b c and so that's the answer to part A now Part B is an interesting question which of the two Elementary steps in this process would you expect to occur at a faster rate explain your answer so it doesn't give us any numerical data here but just based upon what we see in that mechanism we should be able to answer the question and say which one's going to go faster now there's a detail that we talked about earlier on in this unit that will help us to answer that question it has to do with the molecularity of these Steps step one is a bimolecular step it's pretty normal isn't it but what do you notice about step two it has three molecules that is a tur molecular step and guess what tur molecular steps are very rare and if they occur they're going to be very slow so take a look at the answer there it says that step one would be the faster step because it is a bimolecular step tur molecular steps such as in step two are very rare and slow because they require three molecules to collide in the correct orientation and with sufficient energy so this has to do with the molecularity of the of the step in question let's take a look at another question consider the slow steps from two different chemical reactions given below which of the two processes will have the faster rate explain your answer and the processes are fairly similar they're both bimolecular steps so that's not going to help us here but we do have the rate constants we have some numerical data the reaction One Rate constant is 2.8 * 10 -4 of marity or reciprocal marity reciprocal seconds whereas reaction two it's 9.5 * 10us 3r and guess what the number of the rate constant tells us the answer the larger the magnitude of the rate constant the faster the reaction and that's why reaction two goes faster so notice the answer here that's given reaction two will have the faster rate because the magnitude of its rate constant is larger the larger the rate constant the faster reaction hope you've learned about chemical kinetics in my video series here if you're learning something and and you enjoy the videos please slam that thumbs up button and if you leave a

He also discusses the fundamental differences between the system and the surroundings.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmhdr-8E1Mo&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=57,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're starting unit six which is about thermodynamics now we know that chemical reactions are a very important topic in AP Chemistry and all of chemistry for that matter now in our last unit unit five we learned about chemical kinetics which focuses on how fast a chemical reaction goes we're going to be talking about to what extent a reaction goes in our next unit unit 7even that's equilibrium well in this unit we're we going to be talking about why a reaction does or does not occur and that's thermodynamics the heat change that is associated with the chemical reaction that's what we're talking about when we say thermodynamics this is all about the energy changes that take place in natural processes the the thermo in there uh gives us the implication of heat now energy and heat are both measured in Jewels this is the fundamental unit of heat and energy in the SI framework of measurement now just so you know in this course we normally measure and we'll talk about energy and heat in Jewels just be aware that this is not the only unit that's available for us to use you've probably heard of calories that's another very good unit of energy and heat that we could use if we wanted to to do that just be aware that if you ever need to convert one calorie is equal to 4.18 Jews and so it's just a very simple conversion in order to do that now in unit six we're not covering all of thermodynamics we could spend uh honestly years learning about thermodynamics in this unit we're just talking about the first law later on in this course in Unit Nine we'll learn about the second law of Thermodynamics now the first law of thermodynamics in this unit that we're talking about tells us that the total energy of an isolated system is constant so it's certainly possible to transfer energy from one object to another just thermal energy it's possible to transform energy from one form to another the fact is that in any chemical process energy is neither created nor destroyed so that's what the first law of thermodynamics tells us we're not going to be creating we're not going to be destroying energy in these chemical processes now that being said we are constantly transferring energy transforming energy through chemical reactions and in this unit we're going to learn about how we do that and how we calculate those uh those transferences or those Transformations now the word that that we use to talk about how energy or or thermal energy specifically Heat is transferred in these processes is called thermochemistry and usually when we say thermochemistry that specifically refers to the first law of thermodynamics and that's what unit six is all about in AP Chemistry now there are some things that we need to get straight a few definitions before we start jumping into this concept of thermochemistry and thermodynamics we need to to be aware that that in any process or in any chemical reaction we have the system and then we have the surroundings we can classify everything when we're talking about a chemical reaction or or even a physical process into either the system or the surroundings the system specifically refers to the atoms the molecules the ions whatever you're talking about those those part particles that are actually participating in a chemical or physical process so for example if we have uh for example sodium chloride and it's dissolving we're specifically talking about the sodium chloride and how it uh breaks apart into its component ions those that's the system now the surroundings represent everything else in the universe and I know that seems a little bit lofty to talk about that but that's that's what it means the surroundings would be everything in the universe that's not specifically participating in that chemical process or that physical process whatever the case may be that includes the air in the room around a reaction that would be part of the surroundings of course that even includes the beaker or the flask or whatever container you're using in which the reaction is taking place that that container that's not not part of the system it's part of the surroundings and likewise it even includes the water in the beaker in the case of an aquous reaction and so this is this is a little detail here that sometimes even trips up rather experienced chemists because we have to remember that the system is only what's actually participating the water in the beaker in an ious reaction is just the conduit it's just the the solvent in which a reaction is taking place it's not actually participating now if if water is a reactant or or a product then yeah it can be part of the system but if that's not the case the water in the beaker the solvent it's actually part of the surrounding so that's important to remember now whenever we talk about energy transfer in a chemical system a couple of ground rules first of all like we said in that definition of the first law of thermodynamics in a chemical process we're not going to be creating energy we're not going to be destroying energy energy is simply transferred from one uh place to another place or if we have an actual chemical reaction we are Perhaps Perhaps we're transforming that energy from one form into another like from heat and harnessing that and turning it into work just one form of energy turned into another that's okay as well we we realize that we can convert energy sometimes we have a light energy that is one form of energy sometimes it's Sound Energy sometimes it's mechanical energy heat energy different forms of energy we can have one transformed into another and that's perfectly okay now in APK chemistry the two types of energy that we we think about and talk about quite a bit are heat and work heat and work now when we say heat I think we probably know what that means that's the thermal energy that's the ability of this this energy to cause the temperature to go up or to cause it to go down in the case of a loss of thermal energy on the other hand work is the type of energy that allows something to be moved over a distance and so for example if I take a a stapler that's on the table and I lift it up and move it to a different spot I have performed work it's a force that has been performed over the course of a distance that's what work is so we have two different types of energy here uh they're both measured in jewels of course and the SI framework of measurement and they have somewhat different purposes here now when we talk heat we normally use the letter Q to represent that heat now if a system gains heat well we would say that the Q or the sign of Q is going to be positive because the system is well gaining and we know that gaining that's a positive sign that's associated with that on the other hand if the system loses heat that means heat is released by the system into the surroundings then the sign for Q would be a negative value so we're going to come back to that here in a moment so gains heat is positive loses heat as negative work on the other hand we use the letter W to represent work and I think that kind of makes sense W for work if you do work on the system that means that the sign for work is positive I think that kind of makes sense if you have a house and you do work on the house well the the net change in worth of the house is positive isn't you've actually increased the value of the house on the other hand if work is done by the system on the surroundings then work is negative uh so we're going to use these signs here for heat and for work to calculate the change in total internal energy of a system now this equation that you see here is the is the equation for the change in the total internal energy it's Delta e equal q+ W total internal energy change equals heat Plus work now let's try a couple examples with this here we have in a system 60 Jews of heat are absorbed by the system while the system does 50 Jews of work calculate the total internal energy change in this system so once again we're using Delta E equals Q Q Plus a w so we're solving for Delta e now the Q is the heat it tells us that in this in this process here in this system 60 jewels of heat are absorbed by the system that means that the system is gaining those 60 Jews of heat so that's why it's a positive 60 here now it says the system does 50 Jews of work since the system does the work that means that the W is A50 Jew so when you add these together you find that the change in total internal energy is a positive 10 jewels in this system that's how you solve these types of problems now let's say we have this case in this one a system releases 100 jewles of heat while 70 jewles of work are done on the system calculate the total internal energy change in this system so once again we're using the same equation here Delta e equal Q + a w but this time we have q it says we are releasing 100 jewles so if the system is releasing 100 jewles of heat to the surroundings that means from the point of view of the system it's losing 100 Jewels so that's why it's negative and for work if 70 jewels of work are being done on the system well the system is gaining 70 jewles of work so when you add these together 70 minus 100 you have the total internal energy change for the system is30 Jew so that's how you can solve these problems with total internal energy change now when we talk about heat there are like I've said sever several different forms of of energy heat is one of them and we can talk about different forms of heat as well one very important type of heat that we're going to talk about in AP Chemistry is enthalpy now enthalpy is the heat that's associated with the formation and breaking of chemical bonds in a substance now sometimes in chemistry we just take for granted that enthalpy and heat are the same thing that's not really the case um enthalpy is a very specific type of heat for example if you take your hands and you rub them together rather quickly you feel some heat generated right that's frictional heat that's friction well that's not enthalpy okay enthalpy is not the same as friction enthalpy is a different type of heat it's the heat that's associated with the breaking and for and forming of chemical bonds now when we say that we need to to realize that over the course of a chemical reaction there's going to be a change in the heat that's present in those chemical bonds the change in enthalpy is the amount of heat that's absorbed or released over the course of a chemical reaction now the the symbol for enthalpy is H and so change in enthalpy is going to be a Delta H and over the course of unit 6 we're going to learn several different ways to calculate the Delta H for a reaction in fact if my calculations are correct we're going to learn four different ways to calculate Delta H so hang on because we're going to be learning about that over the course of this unit now most of the time when we have a chemical process we are releasing energy that's how most reactions are well you need to be aware that anytime a chemical bond is formed heat is released enthalpy is released that is an exothermic process on the other hand and when a bond is broken it requires the absorption of energy it's an endothermic process now I want to point this out because a lot of students out there sometimes get these confused and somehow they um have a misconception that somehow when you break a bond you're releasing energy that's not how it works it's not like a chemical bond is like a magical glow stick where you break it all of a sudden you know something pops out of it that's not how it works to break a bond you have to invest energy it takes energy to break a bond just like it takes energy to break a pencil or to break a ruler it you have to invest energy it's an endothermic process to break a bond when you form the bond that's when energy is released now we have a couple words here that you've probably seen before exothermic and endothermic the word exothermic specifically talks about reactions or or processes we are where we are releasing Heat by the system into the surroundings so that means that if you put your hand next to an exothermic process your hand is going to feel hot so most chemical reactions that we're familiar with are exothermic processes things like a flame burning and put your hand next to that it feels rather hot doesn't it the surroundings are getting warmer on the other hand endothermic is the opposite that's when the system is actually absorbing heat from the surroundings and since the system is absorbing heat from the surroundings if you put your hand next to the next to a a beaker or something where an endothermic process is taking place it's going to make your hand feel cold the surroundings get colder in endothermic processes so I think intuitively we understand that that you know exothermic is is

"How Heat Flows in Chemical Systems - AP Chem Unit 6, Topics 2-3","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses some of the essential vocabulary for thermodynamics and thermochemistry, such as:  heat, enthalpy, temperature, thermal energy, and average kinetic energy.  He shows how heat flows in a chemical system and how to interpret energy diagrams.  He discusses how molecules interact with each other to allow different systems to achieve thermal equilibrium. 00:00  Topic 6.2 Energy Diagrams 04:37  Topic 6.3 Heat Transfer and Thermal Equilibrium",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwe9ApxkxSU&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=58,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to take a look at unit six sections two and three now in section two we're going to be looking at heat and how uh heat can change over the course of a chemical reaction now earlier in our last video we talked about heat and how that's often called thermal energy and in AP Chemistry specifically there's a type of heat or a type of thermal energy that we're interested in that's called enthalpy now specifically that's the energy or the heat that is associated with the bonds different bonds have different amounts of heat energy different amounts of enthalpy in them now that's a little different than the concept of temperature now you and I both know that you know temperature is basically just how hot or how cold something is in U chemistry and science we might measure that in Kelvin or degrees Celsius some of us might use degrees Fahrenheit or even some other unit of of temperature but when we say temperature what we're actually measuring is the average kinetic energy of the particles now this is important because on the AP exam they like to ask a question or or sometimes multiple questions about this and they'll ask you perhaps you'll have two samples of of matter and they'll ask you which of these two samples of matter have has the greatest average kinetic energy in the molecules and the answer is whichever one has the higher temperature average kinetic energy is is just a fancy way of saying temperature if you have two samples that have the same temperature that means the molecules have the same average kinetic energy that's all that means and I point that out because that does come up quite a bit on the AP curriculum and the exam now most most reactions that we're going to deal with in chemistry are exothermic like we said in the last video that means that heat will be released from the system into the surrounding so what that means is is if you have your hand next to it it's going to feel warm because that heat is being released into the surroundings now graphically what that means is that the reactants have chemical bonds that have higher enthalpy overall than the products do so if you were to draw this graphically this is what it looks like you have a higher enthalpy State at the beginning and then a total lower enthalpy State at the end and that means that over the course of the reaction the the substances here will be losing enthalpy so that's why the change in enthalpy is a negative value it's less than zero now here in our upcoming videos we're going to learn how we actually calculate a numerical value for that now I do I want to point out to you that exothermic reactions are um the most common in fact as we talk about driving forces later on in unit 9 of this course we'll say that the fact that a reaction is exothermic is what we call a driving force for that reaction in other words the universe kind of uh likes EXO thermic reactions they are the the most common type of reaction we'll talk about another driving force in unit 9 now like I said there are other types of reactions there are endothermic reactions and what that means is that the system ends up absorbing heat from the surroundings into the system so if you have your hand next to an endothermic process it's going to feel cold to the touch now graphically what that means is the reactants start out with a low lower enthalpy and then over the course of the process you gain you have a higher enthalpy now you can probably tell that that means that we're gaining so that's why change in enthalpy is a positive number it's going to be greater than zero now endothermic reactions of course do exist but since they require substances to increase their enthalpy State that's not typical from a thermodynamic point of view of course endothermic reactions do take place and that's because of another driving force which we'll talk about in unit 9 now let's move right on to section 6.3 and this section uh discusses how substances T change temperature I should say now let's imagine that we have a nice hot bowl of chicken noodle soup or whatever your your favorite soup might be and if you were to take the temperature of that hot soup you'd find it probably would have a temperature of yeah let's say about 360 kelv that's a a fairly hot bowl of soup now let's say that instead of eating the soup we just leave that soup right there on the table maybe on the dining room table on a perhaps in a classroom and we just leave and we close the door and we leave and we go home what's going to happen to the temperature of that soup well we know that the surrounding air is cooler than the soup it has a temperature of probably around 295 Kelvin well we know that if we just leave that soup in the room over night when we come back the next day maybe 10 hours later the temperature that soup is going to have dropped significantly right down to let's say 296 Kelvin now how does this happen well we know that the temperature of the soup is going to drop but guess what there is a a flow of heat that heat flows from the soup to the surrounding air so that means that the temperature of the soup goes down the temperature of the air goes up slightly until they equilibrate in the middle and the air is also going to have that same final temperature of 296 Kelvin after about 10 hours or so so the these two things air and the soup will eventually have the same temperature now how does this happen how does heat flow from one material to another Well it has to do with the molecules colliding themselves and so let's imagine that we have some molecules in the soup I have those in the red here and those are the warmer molecules and then there's the air around the soup which is cooler I have that represented by the blue molecules here now we know that when warmer particles from that that soup collide with the cooler particles from the air there's going to be some energy transfer and that's because the hot soup molecules are moving faster and the cooler air molecules are going slower so when the soup molecules collide with the air molecules the hot soup molecules transfer some of their kinetic energy to the air molecules and so that cools down the soup molecules and warms up the air molecules now if enough of these collisions take place over enough time it might take a while it might take several hours but eventually enough energy transfer is going to occur so that on average eventually the soup particles are going to have the same kinetic energy as the air particles and so instead of having this temperature differential it'll be more like this where the the soup molecules have the same temperature as the air molecules I hope you've learned something about sections two and three here in unit 6 if you have please slam that thumbs up button and join me in the in the next video where we're going to go on to unit 6 section 4 thanks for watching,"3,817",0,58
"Calorimetry, Specific Heat Capacity, and Q=MCΔT - AP Chem Unit 6, Topic 4","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses how to use the equation Q=MCΔT in calorimetry problems.  He focuses on the meaning of a material's specific heat capacity and works several problems with this equation in increasing difficulty.  Finally, he discusses how calorimeters are used in the chemistry laboratory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn-vRyWu7mI&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=59,"hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to take a look at one way to determine the heat change for a system and like I mentioned earlier we're going to be looking at several ways to calculate the change of heat in a system or for a chemical reaction now this is the experimental way now the equation that we're going to use for this is qal MC delta T now when we have this equation Q is the variable that represents the amount of heat that's released or absorbed by the system and that's going to be given to us or we're going to have to calculate it in jewels and so if you see a value in Jewels that's going to be your your value for Q now M represents the mass of the object and that's just going to be in grams and so that will probably be given to you in the problem now C represents the specific heat capacity of the material now this is a constant and it's a constant that's different for every material the specific heat capacity is normally given to us in Jewels per gram degrees Cs and it has what seem to be funny units most constants have funny units this is just telling us how many jewels it requires to raise one gram of that material by 1° cels so that's the specific heat capacity sometimes it's just shortened and called specific heat that's the the same thing now delta T is the change in temperature of the material so if for example you're going from 10° to 30° that's a change of positive 20° in that material it's is final minus initial temperature if it goes from uh 50° to 100° that's a change of positive 50° if the temperature goes from 70° down to 10° well that's a delta T of 60 so if the temperature drops you have to realize that that is a negative delta T now let's back up here for a second and talk about specific heat when I say specific heat capacity a good way for us to think about that is to imagine specific heat capacity as a way to describe how well a material resists temperature change how well a material resist temperature change so here I have some specific heat capacity values for some common materials now to illustrate this let's just imagine that we have a pot of of water and you're going to boil that on the stove and so you turn on a gas stove or an electric stove or something and you have the the water on the on the stove in the pot and about 30 seconds after you turn the pot on or after you uh turn the stove on rather you touch the bottom of the pot are you going to get burned probably a good chance you will right because that metal that's in the pot heats up very very quickly now on the other hand let's say that you do the same thing take 30 seconds after you turn the the stove on but this time you stick your finger in the water are you going to get burned probably not and that's because water heats up much more slowly than the aluminum or the metal or the copper does in in the pot so this corresponds to specific heat capacities water heats up very slowly and it likewise it cools down relatively slowly that's why it has such a high specific heat capacity it resists temperature change fairly well on the other hand take a look at these things like aluminum or iron or copper these are materials that are found in cookware right because these materials heat up very quickly they cool down very quickly as well and so generally speaking the materials that are on the bottom of this list things like lead and golden honestly almost all these other things here these are considered good conductors of heat whereas the matter or the materials that have the higher specific heat these are going to be considered insulators so water is is actually a very good heat insulator ice is actually a very good insulator of heat as well perhaps you've heard of igloos and that's one of the reasons why they would build an igloo out of ice a very good insulator to be honest now sometimes you may have a specific heat capacity and these are given to you in Jewels per gram degree celsius but the problem might want you to convert this to Jews per mole degree celsus if you asked to do that this is just a simple gam to mole calculation just a simple conversion and it can be converted very simply if you do that then you have What's called the molar heat capacity so specific heat capacity is given in grams the molar heat capacity will be in jewles per mole degre celsus we're going to work a couple problems with these uh equations or with this equation Q equals MC delt T we'll see how this is done a 60.0 G piece of aluminum metal experiences a rise in temperature from 20° C to 52.5 De C if the specific heat capacity of aluminum is 0.897 Jew per gam de cius how much heat energy was absorbed by the aluminum so once again we're going to use qal MC delta T and we're just going to plug and chug into this equation and solve so Q is for heat and that's what we're being asked to solve for it says how much heat energy was absorbed so we're going to solve for Q in this problem M represents the mass of the aluminum and the mass is 60.0 G so I'm going to plug that value in for m in this equation now the C is specific heat capacity and the problem tells us that that value is 897 Jew per G degre celsus so I'm going to plug in that that value for C and then delta T is just my change in temperature since it went from 20° C to 52.5 De C that's a rise of about 32.5 de C so that's my delta T now I just have to multiply and I can solve for Q fairly simply and I get an answer of about 1,750 Jew so that's a very simple problem involving Q equal MC delta T and the heat absorption here let's try another problem silver has a specific heat capacity of. 233 juw per gam degre C A 1 o bar of silver has a mass of 31.1 g and an initial temperature of 20.7 De C if 92 jewles of heat escape from the silver bar to the surroundings what will be the final temperature of the silver so once again we're using qal MC delta T and we just have to plug in chug into the equation here Q is how much heat energy is transferred and here it says that 192 jewles are escaping now since we're losing 192 jewles of heat I'm going to write this as negative 192 Jew now M that's the mass and the mass is just 30 31.1 G so that goes in there for M now C is our specific heat capacity of this material and that's. 233 Jew per gram degre cels so that value goes in for C now the delta T change in temperature the problem doesn't come right out and give me that value but it does tell me that the initial temperature was 20.7 de now it doesn't tell me what the final temperature was was but I know that delta T is final minus initial so I'm going to plug this in as the final temperature T subf I'll call it here minus the initial temperature which was 20.7 de C so now I just have an algebra equation to solve so I'm going to start by isolating the variable so I'll take thetive 192 and divide both sides by 31.1 and 233 when I do that I get - 26.5 = T subf minus 20.7 and so now I can just add 20.7 to both sides and I get an answer that t subf equals Nega 5.8 de C this is a reasonable answer because if heat is escaping that means that the temperature should be getting colder it should be be going down shouldn't it so that's what happens here so this this is the correct answer for the problem let's try one more problem and this one seems to be perhaps a bit more complex we have a 5.00 G piece of iron that is heated in an oven and then dropped into a cup containing 155 G of water at 21.0 De the specific heat of iron is 449 Jew per gram degrees Celsius and the specific heat of water is 4.18 Jew per g degre c if the temperature of the water rises to 22.9 de C what was the initial temperature of the hot iron so it seems like there's a lot going on in this problem isn't there well let's think about this in terms of what's happening in the heat transfer would you agree that when you drop a hot piece of iron into a cup of cold water that the temperature of that iron is going to drop isn't it and likewise the temperature of the water is going to rise so we have a heat transfer here the heat that is lost by the iron is equal to the heat that's gained by the water that's what the first law of thermodynamics tells us however much heat is lost by one material is going to be gained by something else so if we agree that that's the case then this little algebraic statement is correct isn't it this is just saying that the Heat or The Q that's lost by the iron is equal to the heat that's gained by the water that's just a simple algebraic statement of that fact now we also know that Q equals MC delta T and that is an equation that I can use to make an algebraic substitution in here for the Q I'm just going to plug in MC delta T so I have this equation that I've just basically derived I have the negative MC delta T for the iron is equal to the positive MC delta T of the water so now I just have to plug and chug and I can solve for the missing value now m is the mass of the iron isn't it so it says it's a 5.00 G piece of iron so I'm going to plug in the negative M or that netive 5. g in that slot right there now C is the specific heat of the iron and it says it's 449 Jew per gam degre celsus so that goes in there for C now let's think of the delta T for iron that's the final minus initial now the problem doesn't come right out and tell us what the final temperature of the iron is but I think we can figure it out just from the information given to us here we said earlier that the temperature of that hot iron is going to drop isn't it and the temperature of the cold water is going to rise so where are they going to equilibrate well right in the middle right somewhere in the middle so the final temperature of the iron is equal to the final temperature of the water they're going to have the same final temperature and the problem tells us that the final temperature of the water it says it rises to 22.9 de C so for delta T of the iron it's going to be you know final minus initial 22.9 de C minus what I'm solving for because that's what I'm trying to find what was the starting or the initial temperature of the hot iron so now I can go to the other side of the equal sign the mass of the water is 155 G so that goes in there for M the C the specific heat of the water is 4.18 Jew per G degre celius so that goes in for C and now the delta T of the water we see it rises from 21.0 De up to 22.9 de so our delta T is going to be 22.9 minus us 21.0 which you can figure out is 1.9 de C so now we just have an algebra problem to solve so on the left side here I'm going to multiply -5.00 * 449 and that gives me 2.24 I'm going to leave this expression here as it is on the other side when I multiply these values by each other I get 1,231 so now I can divide both sides by - 2.24 as I'm trying to isolate that variable and I get that 22.9 minus the initial temperature equals - 5483 so now when I subtract 22.9 from both sides and do a sign change I find that the initial temperature of the iron block is about 571 degrees C so there's a lot of chemistry going on in this problem there's a lot of math you have to know quite a bit but this is a very typical laboratory type problem where you could determine the initial temperature of a block of metal based on this heat test that you have here very very common laboratory experiment that you could do in AP Chemistry now when we talk about these problems and these experiments that we're talking about in these in these three examples here you might wonder how do we carry them out well these experiments are carried out in a little object called a calorimeter and a calorimeter essentially looks like this we have a cup and we try to use some sort of an insulating material to be honest the best and cheapest insulating material that we can use is honestly just polystyrene or what most people call styrofoam so you have a styrofoam cup and and a cover on it this kind of looks like a coffee cup so sometimes we call this a coffee cup calorimeter uh works pretty simply we just stick a thermometer on the top of it and have perhaps some sort of a stirring object in there and that's how we carry out the experiment in this calorimeter and when we measure heat transfer through this method it's called calorimetry and one thing that you might notice is even though this Styrofoam cup might be closed it's not actually sealed out this container is is really unsealed because air can still get in and out of the calorimeter and this is even more so the case in our everyday chemistry Labs where very often we might not even have a styrofoam cover on the top we might let the Styrofoam cup just be left open this is called constant pressure calorimetry now there is a different type of calorimetry where everything is all sealed up that's called constant volume calorimetry but that type of calorimetry is not uh is actually not addressed in AP Chemistry but that is something that we'll have to save for a different day so hope you enjoyed and learned something from my video about Q equals MC delta T if you did please slam that thumbs up button and I hope to see you in my next video where we move on to unit six section five","5,102",0,59
"Phase Changes and Energy - AP Chemistry Unit 6, Topic 5","In this video, Mr. Krug shows how phase changes such as melting, boiling, condensation, and freezing relate to the energy release (or intake) of a system.  He analyzes a typical heating curve and shows how temperature changes as heat is added to a system and during phase changes.  He finishes by discussing enthalpy of fusion and how this can be used in simple calculations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IFMaefCIhk&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=60,"hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we are taking a look at AP Chemistry unit 6 section five which is all about how heat changes during phase changes so here I have a graph and this is a very common um graph that perhaps you've seen before or this pops up on the AP Chemistry exam I've even seen this on acts as well this is something called a heating curve now essentially what we have here is we have the addition of heat on the x-axis and the temperature on the Y AIS so we can see how a substance is going to respond as we add heat to it now notice that if you have a solid we add heat and it gets warmer the temperature goes up which surprise surprise that's probably not uh any surprises all at all you would have expected that to happen but notice that you keep adding heat and then there's a point at which you add heat but the temperature doesn't go up and what's happening here well this is a process called melting and so this is the melting point so when you have a substance at The Melting Point you add heat but the temperature doesn't go up it stays constant over the melting process now once you get all of the substance melted then it's it's completely a liquid and when you add heat once again the temperature starts to rise as you can he see here in fact it rises more quickly than it did when it was a solid to be honest so we have that and then it just keeps rising and rising and then you keep adding heat and all of a sudden it stops the temperature from rising again what's happening well this is the boiling point and once you get that liquid to the boiling point you add heat but instead of the temperature going up it causes the liquid to boil and so it's vaporizing so you get all of the liquid boiled and once it's all boiled away into a gas then when you start adding heat again now the temperature starts going up again and it's it's all a gas in fact it goes up even faster than when it was a solid or liquid now notice that the heat associated with melting is called the heat of fusion that means how much heat how much thermal energy it requires to melt one gram of a substance heat of vaporization is how much heat it requires to boil one gram of that liquid so let's take a look at a couple questions here which states of matter exist during the melting process if you if you've ever observed a melting Ice Cube I think you know the answer right both solid and liquid during the melting process both of those States can exist at the same time now does the temperature of a substance change as it boils well according to this cooling or to this heating curve rather the answer is no it does not now we can take this this heating curve and flip it in reverse basically and start out as a gas here and then we actually have everything going downhill that would be called a cooling curve and you'd notice that the graph looks pretty much the same except it would be the mirror image of this we'd have you know during the this time it would be the condensation process temperature doesn't change during the freezing process temperature doesn't change let's take a look at this concept of heat of fusion heat of vaporization for a moment here and we'll focus in on heat of fusion for a couple of minutes now let's imagine in fact this is actually correct the the heat of fusion or the enthalpy of Fusion for water is 334 Jew per gram so part A says how much energy must be removed to freeze one gram of water well this is just asking us about the definition of enthalpy of fusion or heat of fusion this heat of fusion here tells us that in order to melt one gram of water one gram of ice you have to add 334 jewles to that water to that ice so guess what if you're going to freeze a gram of water it's the same amount it's just going in reverse and so if you're going to freeze 1 gram of water you have to remove that same 334 jewles from the water so that's the answer it's that it's just 334 Jew now Part B says how much thermal energy would be required to melt a 4B block of ice with a mass of 1,84 14 G well this is essentially just a dimensional analysis problem we start with 1,814 G and we're trying to convert to jewels because it says how much thermal energy so in our conversion factor we have to put grams on the bottom and jewels on the top and the numbers for this conversion factor come right out of that enthalpy of fusion it's 300 34 jewles per one gram so it's going to be like this and when you cancel grams you can multiply across and we have an answer of about 66,000 Jews so that's a lot of jewels isn't it in fact it's so many it's probably probably more convenient to write this in kles and just say it's 606 K so from this video I hope you've learned how to work with heat of fusion heat of vaporization as well if you learned something about this and about heating curves and cooling curves go ahead and slam that thumbs up button and join me in my next video where we're going to take a look at unit 6 section

He works a problem involving enthalpy and shows how heat changes can be calculated using simple reaction stoichiometry.  He shows how a reaction can be manipulated and the resulting effects on change in enthalpy (ΔH).  Finally, Mr. Krug demonstrates a common laboratory problem where the change in temperature of a substance can be used to determine the change in enthalpy of a simple chemical reaction in the chemistry lab.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNPoyiCpLgM&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=61,"hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this video we're going to be taking a look at AP Chemistry unit 6 section six which is all about the stochiometry of heat and enthalpy if you haven't already subscribed to my channel go ahead and subscribe and ring that Bell if you would that way you will be uh notified of all uh these upcoming videos now as we talk about the stochiometry of heat and enthalpy let's take a look at this uh fairly simple chemical reaction right here here we have 2 na solid plus cl2 chlorine gas yields 2 na CL solid and the Delta H for that is negative 822 K per mole what this means basically is that if you have two moles of sodium solid that are being reacted with one mole of chlorine gas you're going to have two moles of sodium chloride solid produced that's just the recipe for this reaction here and this right here is telling us that 822 K of heat are being released so since it's a release of heat that negative sign right there tells us that this process is exothermic now notice what happens when we reverse the process now we can write this reaction basically in Reverse uh just like we can with with most reactions in this case here I've just flipped the reaction notice in this case we have two moles of sodium chloride solid being decomposed and the products are two moles of sodium solid and one mole of chlorine gas but notice what happens to our Delta H when we flip the reaction it changes the sign of Delta H so now for the reverse process it is going to require an absorption ion of 822 K per mole and that means that it would be endothermic so you know flipping the reaction changes the sign of Delta H now we're going to use this concept and this idea of stochiometry and the recipes here basically for producing uh products along with Delta H to solve a couple stochiometry problems so here's the first one we're going to look at it says in the reaction below 10.0 G of sodium chloride solid are produced determine the amount of heat released in this process in kles so we have the same reaction that we started out before and this time it says 10 gram of sodium chloride are produced so I'm going to write that down as my starting value that's what I'm given and the question asks me to determine how much heat is released least in kilog so way down here at the end I'm going to have kogs now in our story geometry process in fact in just about any stochiometry process what's the first step it's always convert to moles isn't it just like we learned way back in unit four so we're going to convert to moles just like we always do all roads lead to moles so in my conversion factor I have to put grams on the bottom here and since I'm converting to moles one mole has to go on top and to find grams in a mole I have to consult the periodic table it looks like the molar mass of NAC sodium chloride will be 8.44 gam in a mole so I have that I can cancel grams top and bottom and so now I'm in moles of sodium chloride now the second step in a reaction story geometry problem is to do the mole ratio right well in this type of problem whenever we have a a a heat or an enthalpy stochiometry process we can actually combine the second and the third step let me show you how I do that I'm going to put moles of sodium chloride on the bottom so I can get rid of both the moles and the sodium chloride and I'm going to put kilog on the top now next to kilog I'm going to have 822 that's right out of the Delta H in the problem and then that has an equivalence to two moles of sodium chloride that's just the coefficient of that balanced equation for NAC so I have an equivalency here and so now I can cancel out the moles I can cancel out the sodium chloride and so now I'm ready to do my math here to solve I just take 10.0 divided by 58.4 time 822 ided 2 and the answer I get is 70.3 K now the negative right there implies that this is exothermic that I'm actually releasing heat over the course of this process so what this is telling me is that if I take 10 grams of sodium chloride and and and produce that in this process I'm going to release 70 .3 K of heat energy in that in that process now let's try one more problem here together and this one says this is a a fairly lengthy question here it says a chemist adds 10. G of calcium chloride to 500 milliliters of water at 23.50 De C stirs and monitors the temperature while the calcium chloride dissolves when the Sol has dissolved completely the temperature has risen to 27.00 De C calculate the enthalpy of solution of calcium chloride assume that that the solution has a density of 1.00 G per milliliter and a specific heat capacity of 4.18 Jew per gam degre C now the problem here is asking us to find the enthalpy of solution now enthalpy of solution enthalpy of reaction eny that's always going to be kog per mole those are the units kog per mole so that implies that I have have actually two calculations here I have to find kogs I have to find the moles let's go ahead and find the uh jewels first we'll do that jewels and the kles part first so in order to do that I use qal MC delta T just like we learned in our earlier video about that so we're going to solve for Q so we can see how many jewels were transferred now m is the mass of this solution total now the total mass is the 10 G of your calcium chloride plus your 500 milliliters or gram of water that's the density so the total mass of this solution is specific heat well the problem tells us that the solution has a specific heat of 4.18 Jew per gram degree celsius so that goes in for C for this uh for this solution now delta T it says that the solution rises from 23.50 De up to 27.00 degrees that's a simple subtraction and it's just 350° C which is by how many degrees that temperature Rose when you multiply these together we get 7,461 jewles so we're going to set that aside for a minute here we have our jewels and now we're going to think about the moles so that's our second step we're going to find the moles of calcium chloride dissolved now that's a simple calculation because it tells us we started with 10.00 G of calcium chloride all we have to do is convert that to moles so in our conversion factor Gams on bottom one mole on top and we consult the periodic table once again and it's about 110. N8 gam in a mole of calcium chloride so now I can cancel grams and divide and it's about 0911 moles of calcium chloride so now all I have to do is find kog per mole now that implies kog divided by moles so earlier in our first step we found out that the Jews were 7,461 I'm going to do a little sign uh change here because I'm realizing that that this is an exothermic process since the temperature goes up it's exothermic so I'm going to put a negative sign here just to signify that I know that the Delta H is going to be a negative value for exothermic moles well we got that in our step two 0911 moles and when you divide this out I get 82,800 Jew per mole now the question is enthalpy of solution we normally put that in kog per mole so I just divide this by th000 and this becomes 82.8 K per mole now what is this mean well that means that we dissolved calcium chloride in water so basically this this chemical process took place the calcium chloride solid was dissociated into its component ions the calcium ions and the two chloride ions well the Delta H for that process is 82.8 K per mole we can calculate that and determine that in the lab fairly easily you can see right here hope you learned something about the stochiometry of heat and enthalpy here if you learned something please slam that thumbs up button and I hope to see you in our next video as we continue and do some more practice on unit 6 section six about heat and stochiometry I'm Jeremy Krug thanks for watching this video","3,993",0,61
"Problem Walkthroughs - Enthalpy of Reaction - AP Chem Unit 6, Topic 6b","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students the fundamental difference between heat and change in enthalpy.  He then walks students through a typical problem involving the calculation of enthalpy of reaction (ΔH).  In this problem, students learn how to calculate the enthalpy of reaction for a simple precipitation reaction in the laboratory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y97W1aqDcps&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=62,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're moving on with the next part of unit 6 section six we're going to do some more practice with enthalpy of solution and how to calculate Delta H if you haven't subscribed to my channel yet go ahead and do that click that Thumbs Up Button if you learned something from my video And subscribe and ring that Bell that way you won't miss out on this uh complete AP Chemistry course now before we jump into this next example let's talk about the difference between q and Delta H because in the last several videos we've been working with both of these values and sometimes it seems like they're very similar to each other but we need to understand that there's a fundamental difference between these two now Q whenever we talk about Q equals MC delta T for example Q is how much heat how much thermal energy is actually being transferred in the process notice that the unit for Q will be jewels in the SI framework of measurement on the other hand when we're working with Delta H that's the change in enthalpy for the reaction the units are different we're not just talking about jewels it's Jewels per mole or kilog per mole so in order to solve for Delta H we have to do essentially two calculations we have to find the jewels and that will be in usually qals MC delta T and then we have to calculate the moles which will be a stochiometry uh problem now normally in these problems that we work we're normally going to express Delta H as Delta H with this little degree sign here now I think this is the first time that we're looking at this in this AP Chemistry course so it it is worth it to look at what that degree sign actually means when you see that degree sign on a value and it's not just going to be Delta H it'll be other things later on in this course it's referring to the fact that we're at standard conditions and these are the standard conditions that are most common in Laboratories if you go around the world so we're talking about standard conditions which are 25° C you know pretty close to what most Laboratories will be set at about one atmosphere pressure and 1.00 moles per liter concentration in the case uh of any solutions that you might be working with so if you see that degree sign you know that we're at standard conditions and to make our lives easier usually we just deal with standard conditions now let's do an example here it says a chemist mixes 30.0 milliliters of 50 molar silver nitrate with 30 milliliters of 50 molar potassium chloride stirs and monitors the temperature while the solutions mix a white precipitate forms and the temperature rises from 23.00 De C to 26.8 De C write the net ionic equation for the reaction and determine the Delta h of the reaction in kilog per mole assume the solution has a density of 1.00 G per milliliter and a specific heat capacity of 4.18 jewles per gram degre Celsius so kind of a long problem looks like there's a lot going on here couple things that you want to isolate we're being asked to write two things here the net ionic equation which we learned how to do already way back in unit 4 and the Delta H that's kog per mole now let's focus on the net ionic equation first now like we learned back in back in unit 4 we know that we have these two solutions we have silver nitrate and since both these are soluble we know that they're going to exist in their ionic form so silver nitrate will actually be silver cat ions and nitrate and ions swimming around and then the potassium chloride will be potassium C ions and chloride ions swimming around in solution as well we know that these ions are going to try to swap partners and so we'll have something like this and our job is to determine which of those two pairs is going to make something that is an insoluble solid or as we call it a precipitate well if you think back to your solubility rules you will realize that it's silver getting with Chlor chide that means that pottassium and nitrate ions aren't doing anything they're just the The Spectator ions here so when we write the net ionic equation it's going to be silver catons aquous plus chloride anons aquous they'll get together and form a product of solid silver chloride agcl so that's the net ionic equation so that's the the first part of this now let's do the second part part where we're trying to determine the actual Delta h of this of this reaction right here that we just wrote it doesn't matter which order we do this in we're going to have to find the kilog we're going to have to find the moles uh let's just do the moles part of it first this time I think last time we did it the other way let's just do the moles first this time so in our equation in our net ionic equation let's think about how many moles of silver ions we're starting with and this is just a simple gometry calculation we have 30 millit which will actually be 00300 L and let's multiply that by the 050 moles per liter and when you multiply that out you find that we're starting with 0150 moles of silver ions now for chloride it's done the same way we take the 03 L of chloride times that by .5 moles per liter and of course that's going to give us the same number 0150 moles of chloride so let's think about this in terms of the stochiometry if we're starting with 0015 moles of silver ions and 015 moles of chloride ions how many moles of silver chloride will we get as our product well it's a one to one: one ratio as you look at the uh the moles here mole ratio so that means that we're going to have 0150 moles of silver chloride produced it's not twice that it's not it's not adding them together it's just one to one to one the mole values will be the same so we're going to be making 0150 moles of silver chloride so that's the moles part of this now let's do the jewels or the kilog part of this next so to do this we're going to have to use qal MC delta T so we're going to do this just like we did in the last example in the last video we're solving for Q so that's our unknown the mass what is the total mass of this solution well we have 30 milliliters being added to 30 milliliters so that's a total of 60 milliliters total we're assuming that the volumes are additive so 60 milliliters and if the solution has a density of 1 G per milliliter that means that the mass of the solution will be 60 G so that's our M now the C the specific heat of the solution it tells us in the problem will be 4.18 jew per gam degre Celsius and that delta T is easy to calculate too because it's going from 23.00 degrees C up to 26.8 so that's a a rise of 3.8 0° C so we can take our calculator and multiply these numbers by each each other and we get a value for Q of about 953 Jews now I'm going to go ahead and turn this into a negative 953 Jew now there are a couple reasons for this and some students get a little confused as to why we do the sign change a couple ways to think about this the first way is think about this as the fact that this is an exothermic process if the temperature of the solution is rising that tells us that this has to be exothermic so the Delta H is going to have a negative value so heat is released so I'm going to put a negative there okay so anytime you have a temperature rising in that solution it's got to be exothermic Delta H is negative another way to think about it this is this is the same thing this is just a different way of thinking about it um whenever you take the temperature of a solution remember we are measuring the temperature change of the surroundings not not the system the water in that in that calorimeter actually is part of the surroundings it's not really possible for us to measure directly the temperature change of the system because the system is solely composed of the silver ions and the chloride ions and the silver chloride that's produced and we can't really measure that so we have to measure the temperature of the surroundings so since we're measuring the the the temperature change of the surroundings we have to flip it flip the sign to find the the temperature change or the heat change in this case of the of the system so that's why I had to to flip the sign there a couple different ways to think about it the net result is the same now if I want to go ahead and change this to kilog that's just of course uh point or rather negative kilog so now I'm ready to go right ahead and calculate Delta H so it's kles per mole so I just got the kles that's the .953 K and we calculated the moles to be 0150 moles so when I divide the numerator by the denominator I get an answer of about 63.5 K per mole that's the Delta h of this reaction hope you learned something from this video video if you did please smash that Thumbs Up Button hope you're subscribed if not so please consider doing that that that really would mean a lot to me helps the algorithm out a lot too if you uh like and leave a comment down there in the next video we're moving on to one of the ways a different way

"Calculating ΔH Using Bond Enthalpies - AP Chem Unit 6, Topic 7","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to use bond enthalpy to calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for a reaction.  He works two problems.  The first problem is a fairly straightforward ΔH calculation, and in the second, students are asked to use ΔH to calculate an unknown bond enthalpy value.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3FziIDJjdk&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=63,"hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to take a look at unit 6 section 7 which is about how we calculate the Delta h of a reaction from Bond enthalpy data now in the last video in last couple of videos we learned how to calculate Delta H experimentally using qal MC delta T doing a stochiometry calculation and then dividing kles by moles well in this one we're going to look H at how we can actually uh determine that Delta h using some uh data that we can get very easily very readily just online or in a textbook now this is the equation that we're going to use to do that the Delta h of a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpies of all the bonds broken in a reaction minus the sum of the enthalpies of all the bonds that are formed in a reaction now how do we do this well let's try a very common reaction here we have methane and one mole of methane is being reacted with two moles of oxygen gas to produce one mole of carbon dioxide and two moles of water now in order to to do this problem to calculate Delta H using this methodology we have to have the structures we have to understand that the bond structures and the molecular geometries of these molecules so this goes all the way back to 2 when we drew these Lewis electron dot diagrams so if you remember that this is going to be very useful for this problem now we're being given a list of data here these are the bond enthalpies for all the chemical bonds that are participating in this reaction so using this data we can calculate Delta H now we'll start with the CH4 here we can draw the Lewis electron do diagram for methane if you've forgotten how to do that that then go back to unit two and you can see how to how to draw this structure in the structure you can see that we have four of these carbon hydrogen single bonds and each carbon hydrogen single bond has an enthalpy of 413 K per mole so if we multiply that out 413 * 4 that gets us a total of 1,652 K for those bonds right there now how about the O2 well notice I have two of those so I'm going to go ahead and just draw two of those and we have oxygen oxygen the double bonds and those have a bond enthalpy of 495 K per mole so since we have two of those I'm going to have to multiply that value by two and so I get 990 k for that part of the problem next I have the carbon dioxide hopefully you'll remember that the Lewis electron dot diagram for carbon carbon dioxide looks something like this and we have uh two of these carbon oxygen double bonds and those have a bond enthalpy of 799 KJ per mole so since we have two of those I'm going to multiply it by two and I get 1,598 K next we have water but notice we have two water molecules so I'm going to draw two water molecules here and you'll notice that we have oxygen hydrogen s bonds that's all we have here but we have four of them so we're going to have to multiply the four by its Bond enthalpy which is 467 K per mole so when I multiply that out I get 1,868 K now with that done all we have to do is take the sum of the bonds that are broken minus the sum of the bonds that are formed now the bonds that are broken are the ones on the left side of this equation so that would be all these on the reactant side so when I add those together the 1652 plus the 990 I get that the bonds broken are 2,642 K now if I do the same thing on the right side that's my enthalpy for the bonds formed so add those together I 3,466 KJ so just take the left side minus the right side Bond's broken minus bonds formed and when I subtract that out I find that the Delta H for this reaction is about 824 K that makes sense because this is an exothermic value negative Delta H is exothermic and this is a combustion reaction pretty much all combustion reactions are going to be exothermic so this is a a value that makes sense so that's how you use the bond enthalpies to calculate Delta h of a reaction let's try another example I want you to notice that this one's a little bit different though it says use the reaction and the bond enthalpy data below to calculate the hydrogen hydrogen bond enthalpy so little bit different strategy here we're given the overall Delta H and we have to I suppose work backwards and find out what the hydrogen hydrogen single Bond enthalpy is we don't know what that is according to the problem well we're going to do this the same way we'll start with the n2h4 the hydren there and so we have looks like we have two types of bonds here we have a nitrogen nitrogen single Bond and so that is 297 K per mole we also have four of these nitrogen hydrogen single bonds and those are 460 K per mole so I'm going to multiply that number by four since I have four bonds and that's 1,840 KJ now on the product side I have nitrogen gas into when you draw that out you'll find that it is a triple bond and the triple bond has a very high Bond Dental which you would expect triple bonds would have a very you know a lot of lot of energy in there so we have 950 K per mole a lot of energy released when that bond is formed and it takes a lot of energy to break it as well so 950 only one of those bonds now the H2 we H we do have two of those molecules but we don't know what that is we're trying to solve for that so we can call that value X or n but either way we have two of those so I'll just call it 2 N in this case now remember the equation we take the sum of the bonds broken so that's 2,137 K minus the bonds formed so that's 950 + 2N in this case and bonds broken minus bonds formed equal Delta H now this time the problem tells us what the Delta H is it's right here 3177 KJ per mole so I'm going to plug that in right here and then bonds broken that's 2137 minus the bonds form that's 950 + 2 N now be very careful when you solve here remember to be careful with those signs you don't want to to mess the signs up and get the wrong answer so when I distribute this negative sign across everything inside the parentheses I get 317 = 2137 - 950 - 2N and so when I you do the subtraction and know bring this over to the other side I get that 2N equals 870 so divide both sides by two and I find that the n or the the value for the hydrogen hydrogen single Bond enthalpy is 435 kog per mole which is very close to the actual literature value for that Bond enthalpy I hope this video has helped you to learn how to calculate Delta H using Bond enthalpies if you've learned something please smash that Thumbs Up Button And subscribe if you haven't done so already leave a comment down below it really does help the algorithm I do appreciate you watching this video my name is Jeremy kug I've been teaching AP Chemistry for 24 years and in the next video

"Using Enthalpy of Formation to Calculate ΔH - AP Chem Unit 6, Topic 8","#apchem #enthalpy #apchemistry   In this video, Mr. Krug begins by showing students what enthalpy of formation (or heat of formation) means and works several examples.  Then, he shows how the enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the change in enthalpy for a chemical reaction using a simple equation.  He works several examples.  In this final example, he shows how students can calculate the enthalpy of formation of an unknown substance, given the ΔH of the reaction and the enthalpies of formation of the remaining substances in the reaction.  00:00 What is Enthalpy of Formation? 03:29 How to Calculate ΔH -

242 K per mole if we were trying to find the enthalpy of formation of ammonia well ammonia is NH3 and that composed of nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas N2 and H2 well to make exactly one mole of ammonia well you have to have half of an N2 to make that n right there and to make three hes three hydrogens you have to have one and a half H2S three halves H2 so that's why we have these these kind of strange looking fractional coefficients in some of these equations but that that has to be the case in in order to have your product your your compound having a coefficient of exactly one the Delta h of that process is 46 K per mole we could do the same thing for something even a little bit more complex like calcium sulfate cao4 that's made of calcium and sulfur and oxygen which we can write as CA calcium s can be our sulfur oxygen can be O2 well to make EX ly one mole of calcium sulfate we have one mole of calcium one Mo of sulfur and two moles of oxygen gas O2 so that that way it adds up to exactly one mole of calcium sulfate and your Delta H here is 1,435 KJ per mole now I want you to notice that in pretty much all these cases we're using the standard enthalpy of formation that's this little degree sign here we looked at that in the last video but this is worth repeating because we're going to be seeing this several times throughout AP Chemistry that degree sign represents the fact that we're at standard conditions so that's 25° C if there are any gases present which we do have in most of these one atmosphere pressure if there are any solutions they would be at 1 mole per liter concentration now how do we calculate Delta h of a just a random reaction using these enthalpies of formation well the way we do this is we take the sum of the enthalpies of formation of all the products and then we subtract the sum of all the enthalpies of formation of the reactants so let's try a few examples of this we'll we'll actually use the same reaction that we used in the last video we'll see if we get an answer that's somewhat similar to what we got in the last example in the last time we tried this so in in this equation methane has an enthalpy of formation of -75 kog per mole now since there's only one mole of methane here there's the coefficient of one understood to be there well the value is still negative 75 K now for oxygen its enthalpy of formation is zero now we're going to find a lot of zeros as we work through these problems here in this video and in some in the future too that's normal because remember the enthalpy of formation is how much heat it takes to form that from its elements well in this case its element it already is an element so there is no formation to talk about so that's why it's it's it's just zero pretty much any element in its most natural state will have an enthalpy of formation of zero so we'll see a lot of those now there are two moles of this so we have to multiply that by two but but you know 0 * 2 is of course still zero now on the other side of the arrow we have the carbon dioxide gas its enthalpy of formation is 394 K per mole with there only being one mole of this that's still - 394 K we have water in its gaseous state and its enthalpy of formation is 242 kog per mole and there are two moles of that as we see with that coefficient of two so we have to times this value by two and we get - 484 K so we can add together the reactants over here and that math is pretty easy it's it's -75 KJ we can add the products together over here these two values and when you add those together you get 878 kog and notice that the Delta H is just products minus reactants so it's negative 878 minus a75 K be careful with those signs because we know that two negatives make a positive here in this case so when you do the arithmetic here you find that the Delta h of this reaction is about 83 K per mole so it's pretty close to the answer that we got in the last video for this very same reaction now you might be wondering where do we get these numbers we have you know this -75 the minus 394 what do those constants come from because every substance will have its own specific enthalpy of formation well there is a table of standard entropies of formation if you have a textbook you can consult the textbook to find out what it is it's probably in the appendic if you're uh watching this video along with my workbook then my workbook has the a standard table of thermodynamic constants in there these values are are in there these are just standard literature values that you can look up so we're going to use those numbers here to calculate the Delta h of this reaction so once again we'll take the ammonium chloride and if you look that value up it's - 314.444.4444 .8 K on the other side of the arrow we have ammonia which is - 45.9 K per mole and there are two moles of this so that's going to be 91.8 kles then we have the hydrogen which has an enthalpy of formation of zero and that makes sense because it's a it is a typical element uh you know pretty much all elements in their most natural state will be zero there's only one mole of that still zero chlorine is also zero and there's only one mole of that so it's zero as well so now we can add up the reactant and that's of course it's just 6288 K and then we can add up all the products over here and that mathod is still pretty easy as well it's about 91.8 K and so to calculate Delta H it's products minus reactants so it's NE 91.8 K minus that 6288 K now two negatives make a positive so when you do the math here it ends up being a positive 537 K per mole so that's the Delta h of this reaction this is a an endothermic process and we know that because the Delta H is positive let's try one more example this one's a little a little bit different from the others though it says that Delta h of the following reaction is equal to positive 150 K per mole determine the heat of formation of sodium oxide so this one's a little bit different isn't it uh we can look up two of these values in our table of standard thermodynamic data but we're going to have to leave the sodium oxide as an unknown so if you look this value up the sodium hydroxide on your table it ends up being about 425.31 point8 K now we're trying to calculate or determine the heat of formation of that sodium oxide right there so we can call that n or X or whatever you want to call it and there's only one mole of that so it's still just going to be X kilog jewles and then water in its liquid state is - 285.0 kilj per mole now you might notice that this is not the same value as we had in the last example for water we had water as a gas uh be very careful whenever you're writing out these these values make sure that you match up the correct state of matter because the liquid value for enthalpy of formation is different from the gas gous phase so just double check that when you solve these problems well now we have the sum of the reactant is just 8518 the sum of the products will be actually x minus 285.0 so now we're going to plug into this equation the Delta H equals the sum of the products minus the sum of the reactants we know what the Delta H is the problem tells us that it's positive 150 K per mole and then the products are x - 25.8 minus the reactant which is 8518 I've left off the unit here for brevity sake but it's all going to work out in the end as I'm sure you know let's simplify this let's uh distribute this negative sign over other negative here in parentheses and so that gives us 150 = x- - 2885.805763 2016 K per mole hope you've learned something about enthalpy of formation what it is how to use it and how we can use this in finding Delta H this gives us a third way of calculating Delta H in the next video which is going to be Unit 8 section 9 we're going to learn a fourth and final way to calculate Delta H and that's called hess's law I'm Jeremy Krug if you learned something please smash that thumbs up button and join me in the next video","2,978",0,64

Manipulating 3 Equations",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0Qlv_uXVvU&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=65,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug in this video we're going to learn a fourth way to calculate the Delta h of a reaction uh if you haven't already subscribed to my channel uh I would like to invite you to do that so you can keep up to date on all the AP Chemistry lessons right here in this uh on my channel here so let's take a look at this fourth and final way that we're going to learn about to determine the Delta h of a reaction the change in enthalpy of course now this is a pretty neat little uh trick that you can use if you take two reactions these are two completely different chemical reactions we have a plus b yield C and it has a specific enthalpy of of reaction we'll call that X and here's a separate reaction underneath it uh D plus C yields B plus e and its uh change in enthalpy is a completely different value why well you might notice that you can take these two reactions over here and you can actually add them together to get a third completely different reaction the B's will cancel and the C's will cancel and when you add the two reactions you get a plus d yields e so a completely different reaction than the first two reactions that you had well guess what if you can add the first two reactions and get a third reaction well to find the Delta h of this third reaction all you have have to do is add up the individual Delta H's for those reactions and so the Delta H for this new reaction is just x + y so this is actually a pretty neat way to calculate the Delta h of a reaction we call this hess's law and these problems are actually uh in fact I kind of like these to be honest because it's almost like solving a puzzle all you have to do is is manipulate these equations so so that they add up to get you the overall equation that you're trying to solve for so here's an example of that we're given two separate chemical equations separate reactions here each of those has its own change in eny its own Delta H and we're asked to use those two Delta H values for these reactions to determine the Delta h of this other third reaction so once again all we have to do is somehow manipulate these two reactions up top here so that they add up to give us the overall balanced equation at the end this is kind of like solving a puzzle um one thing I notice is that in the overall equation n204 needs to be on the left it needs to have a coefficient of one well the only place that N24 pops up in these other equations is in number one up here and it is on the left and it has a coefficient of one so it looks like that equation is okay I don't have to do anything to that on the other hand though take a look at n o n o is on the right side of the arrow whereas n o up in this other that equation number two it is on the wrong side it's on the left side so I'm going to need to flip equation number two now remember what happened when I flip an equation what happens to the Delta H well back in an earlier part of this unit we said that that changes the sign so when I flip this equation around Delta H becomes a positive 56.6 just like so now the n o I just need to have it where it has a coefficient of two and it doesn't this only has a coefficient of one so I'm gonna have to double this equation here equation number two when I double that it's going to double the Delta H so when I multiply all those coefficients by two it looks like this and my new Delta H is a doubled as you can see it's a positive 57.9 Plus 113.27520 time but given these first three reactions and their individual Delta H's we should be able to add them up and get this overall balanced equation down here at the bottom so let's go ahead and just jump into this let's start with the carbon we notice that in the overall equation or our final equation I should say carbon is on the left side and it has a coefficient of one and the only place I see carbon up top here is up here in equation number one it is on the proper side of the arrow and it does have the right coefficient so I'm not I'm actually just going to leave that equation alone let's take a look at water water needs to be on the left side it needs to have a coefficient of one and if I look for water up top here I see water in equation number three but it's on the wrong side of the arrow so I'm going to have to flip equation number three so when I flip it it changes the sign so I flip it it's going to going to be a positive 4836 so that's that's good well now I also notied that water has the wrong coefficient it needs to have a coefficient of one but it has a coefficient of two up up top here so I need to divide all these coefficients in half so I'm going to have a one a one and I guess a 1/2 in front of the oxygen that's going to mean my Delta H gets cut in half as well so when I do that it's going to be a positive 241.7 KJ per mole so that's that's good there for the water let's go on to the co the carbon monoxide when I look for carbon monoxide up top I see it in equation number two and we kind of have the same problem with this as we did with the the water it's on the wrong side of the arrow so I need to flip equation number two and that's going to change the sign of of Delta H that's going to make this a positive 566.062 now becomes a positive 283 and if I've done everything I believe that everything is going to add up now in fact it looks like I can cancel out a few things I can cancel out the carbon dioxides on both sides I see one oxygen here that I can cancel out with one oxygen over here know the 1/2 and 1/2 you know that cancels out with the one2 and everything else adds up so now all I have to do is take a calculator and add these these values together 393.7 plus 283.15 and I get a total value that Delta H equals positive 131.35 MC delta T and then take kles and divide by moles we've learned about hess's law here we've learned about uh Bond enthalpies you know bonds broken minus bonds formed and we've also learned about enthalpies of formation uh the the products minus the reactants hope you've enjoyed this video hope you've learned something about hess's law if you have please smash that Thumbs Up Button thank you for following along here in unit 6 in our next video we're going to jump right into unit 7 which is about chemical

"What Is Equilibrium? AP Chemistry Unit 7, Topic 1 Daily Video","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses reversible reactions and describes the concept of dynamic equilibrium using the ""dance floor problem.""  He demonstrates equilibrium graphically and shows what equilibrium is and what it is not. 00:00  Reversible Reactions 02:40  Equilibrium in a Closed System 04:08  The Dance Floor Problem - Visualizing Equilibrium 11:22  What Equilibrium is NOT 12:41  What Equilibrium IS 13:21  Equilibrium: A Graphical Representation",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmks1z6PT6U&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=66,we start unit 7 with a discussion of what is equilibrium now in order to do this we need to realize first of all that many reactions in chemistry are irreversible now what does that mean well let's say that we have a nice uh truck here and this looks like a classic vehicle maybe this was brand new back in the 1950s but we know that over time something is going to happen to the iron in that vehicle it's going to rust that iron solid is going to react with oxygen gas and it's going to produce iron 3 oxide solid which we call rust as far as we know there really isn't much of a way for this rust for this iron 3 oxide on that truck to reverse course and turn back into a nice uh shiny vehicle with that iron instead that's why we say that a reaction like this is irreversible it goes only in One Direction and that direction is the forward Direction the iron reacts with the oxygen makes the product but we're probably not going to have the reverse of this on the other hand a lot of reactions in fact we can say that most reactions in chemistry are reversable now let me show you what I'm talking about let's say we have this uh fairly simple reaction right here where we have two moles of hydrogen gas reacting with one mole of oxygen gas to create two moles of water in the liquid form now perhaps you've seen this before in your chemistry class or you've seen videos of this I have a video of this in fact this is actually a screenshot of a video that I recorded a few years ago where I'm taking a balloon of hydrogen and I'm basically blowing it up and we have this Fireball here and in the midst of that we're making a little bit of water now we can reverse that reaction we can actually take some water and we can run a current of electricity through it like we see with this 9vt B battery and we can produce hydrogen gas and oxygen gas and we see those gases being formed as they Bubble Up from the electrodes there so yes we have this reaction that is reversible it can go in both directions we can have a forward a forward reaction we can have a reverse reaction so when that's the case we usually just write it like this where we have the reaction you can write it in either direction to be honest it doesn't matter but we write a double double-headed Arrow there and that double-headed Arrow represents the fact that this reaction can go in both directions it is reversible now what does equilibrium look like in a closed system how can we take maybe a flask or something and illustrate what that would look like well here's a typical fairly simple chemical reaction hydrogen gas plus chlorine gas yields two moles of hydrogen chloride gas so at the beginning it would be most likely that in that flask or that container you would put most likely just reactants so you'd have the hydrogen and the chlorine in there as we see in this diagram right here well as the reaction proceeds you're going to have some of those hydrogen molecules reacting with the chlorine molecules to make HCL but remember that since this is a reversible reaction you're also going to have some of those hydrogen chloride molecules that are going to go in the reverse Direction and they're going to make H2 and c and cl2 so at equilibrium this might be a good representation of what you might have maybe you'll have mostly product but you're still going to have some of that reactant in there now where did that reactant come from well some of the HCL reacted it went in the reverse Direction and produced some of that H2 and that cl2 so at equilibrium you're going to expect a mixture of both reactants and products now let's take a look at this in a mathematical way now in order to do this to talk about what equilibrium is and how this works mathematically we're going to carry out a thought experiment so we don't do a whole lot of these in this video of course but I think this is worth it because this illustrates how equilibrium Works in a mathematical point of view now in order to to to illustrate this we're going to imagine that we're going to a dance maybe it's a homecoming dance or prom or some other dance that you've been to before and we're going to imagine that we start the dance with 300 people there are 300 people that funnel into the gymnasium and you know generally speaking at the beginning of a dance nobody's dancing people don't like dance their way into the gym or anything like that usually they are not dancing ing when they they walk in there so what we have here is zero dancing 300 that are not dancing now we're going to imagine that after every single song 30% of the people that are dancing are going to sit down and and stop dancing and likewise after every song 20% of the people that are not dancing are going to get up and start dancing so that's the the basis for our calculations here what that means is that for the first song 30% of zero well that's zero will stop dancing because there was nobody dancing to start with but 20% of these 300 will get up and start dancing and 20% of 300 is 60 so we have a zero going in the direction of the of the sidelines and 60 in the direction of the Dance Floor that means we're going to have a net gain of 60 in the direction of the Dance Floor so for the this next song we're going to have 60 people dancing and 240 people not dancing and this process is going to repeat itself after every song 30% of 60 is 18 so 18 people after that song will sit down but 20% of 240 which is about 48 will get up and start dancing now if you look at the math that's a net direction of 30 in the direction of the dance floor so the Dance Floor goes up by 30 the the sidelines those who are not dancing will go down by 30 so it's 90 to10 notice that at every step of the way we still have 300 people we've not invented new people or eliminated people they're still the same number of people 300 after the next song 30% of 90 are going to sit down so that's that's 27 and then 20 % of 210 are going to get up and start dancing so that's 42 so looking at the math it's a net direction of plus 15 in the direction of the dance floor so the Dance Floor goes up to 105 the sidelines go down by 15 to 195 and the process repeats 30% of 105 32 and then 20% will have 39 who get up and and start dancing so in this case it's a direction or it's a net gain of seven for the dance floor so Dance Floor goes up to 112 the not dancing goes down to 188 and this process just keeps repeating and maybe you can see what's what's eventually going to happen we have you know 30% of 112 sit down that's 34 and then 20% of the 188 get up and start dancing so that's 38 so this time it's a net gain of four in the direction of the dance floor so the Dance Floor goes up by four the sidelines go down by four and the process repeats for the next one it's you know 30% of 116 so that's 35 sit down and then 20% of 184 get up and start dancing so that's 37 so in this song Here we have a net gain of two in the direction of the dance floor so the Dance Floor goes up by two the sidelines go down by two you can probably see what's going to happen here right if we keep on doing this so after the next song 30% sit down that's 35 20% of those not dancing get up and start dancing so this time it's a net gain of one in the direction of the dance floor so it's 119 181 what happens now well after this song 30% of our 119 are going to sit down so that's 3 six and 20% of 181 are going to get up and start dancing that's 36 so do you see what's happened here we have a net gain of zero in any direction so that means that we have the same number of people getting up and dancing as we have sitting down so the net Direction the net change is zero so for the next song it's still 119 and 181 and so guess what that's going to repeat 36 and so it keeps on going like that so you see what's happened we have attained what I guess we can call Dance Floor equilibrium so when was that dance floor equilibrium established well right around this spot here where we were able to say that the the number of people that sat down was equal to the number of people who got up and start dancing so what happened at equilibrium well you attained a point where the net change of people on the dance floor and likewise the number of people not dancing basically ended up being constant and so your your net change was Zero now let's analyze this for a second once we got to dance floor equilibrium right around this point right here did that mean that the dance was over no by no means in fact we could say that as long as we still have 300 people and we still have that 119 and 181 one split here and the DJ is willing to keep playing and this 30% 20% business here keeps on going that these numbers are going to stay the same essentially forever or at least for as long as this dance continues the dance was not over at equilibrium in fact you could make the case that the dance is just getting started once equilibrium is established now once you got to to dance floor equilibrium did the two sides sides you know the the dancing side and the not dancing side have equal numbers of people and we can see that they did not in fact the not dancing side had a whole lot more than the side that was dancing so I hope this this thought experiment helps us to understand a little bit about what's happening at equilibrium now let let's apply this to to chemistry here what equilibrium is not first of all once a reaction attains equilibrium the reaction does not stop it's not like the reaction has has halted once you get to equilibrium in fact we could make a case that the reaction is just getting started because there is a damic equilibrium in fact that's sometimes why we call this dynamic equilibrium because the forward reaction is just taking place at the same rate as the reverse reaction at equilibrium do not expect that the concentrations of the reactants are going to be equal to the concentrations of the products in fact most of the time that's not going to be the case you may have more uh products you may have more reactants they're not probably going to be the same at equilibrium do not expect all the reactant to be used up just like in that dance floor problem we never got to a point where all 300 people were dancing the same thing in a chemical reaction you're not really ever going to use up all the reactant at equilibrium you'll still have at least some of that reactant present so what is equilibrium well once you get to equilibrium the rate of the forward reaction and the reverse reaction are equal that's what that means so what that means from a a macro chemistry point of view view as we measure the concentrations that means that the concentrations have stopped changing so that's like in our Dance floor problem the number of people on the Dance Floor was equal all the way beyond that and likewise the number of people that were not dancing once it got to that 181 concentrations or amounts stopped changing now let's take a look at this graphically I just took the the numbers from that dance floor problem and I just graphed them so that's all that we have here on this graph and here we have the number of people that are not dancing in red and the number of people that are dancing graphed in blue so the question is first of all at what point in the dance was movement taking place the fastest and I think you can see that both by looking at the numbers that we did earlier and by looking at the graph here you can see that at the very beginning that's where the slope or where the magnitude of the slope was the highest you know in the case of the dancing side it shot up the fastest at the beginning and the the not dancing side shot down the fastest at the beginning and so we can generalize that to chemical reactions too we actually mentioned this all the way back in unit five that at the very beginning of a chemical reaction in most cases that's where the reaction rate is going to be the fastest and then as the reaction proceed ceeds forward the reaction eventually uh will taper off and the concentration will eventually stop changing once you get to equilibrium like you see here now once again what does the graph look like at equilibrium well as you can see once you get to that equilibrium stage right around here somewhere the graphs in fact both of the graphs Flatline or as we could say from an algebra point of view the slope is equal to zero once you get to equilibrium now let's take an actual chemical reaction so we're actually going to apply this to a a real reaction now here I have nitrogen gas plus three moles of hydrogen gas yield two moles of ammonia gas this is this is sometimes called the hab Bosch process for making ammonia and we can see here that we have these three substances and they're they're graphed over over time so the first question I have here is which of the substances starts at a zero concentration I think you can see that pretty simply just by reading the graph it's the NH3 isn't it that ammonia starts at zero concentration now hope that makes sense to you because if you look back at the equation you see that ammonia is the product and normally you wouldn't expect there to be any product or much product when you start the reaction we normally start with reactants and that's that's kind of what we have here the H2 and the N2 were certainly more prevalent now which of the reactants that's H2 or N2 is depleted at the faster rate can you tell just by looking at the graph hopefully you can see that H2 is shooting down the fastest into is shooting down not quite as fast so we can say that hydrogen is the completed at the faster rate now you can also if you will remember back to unit 5 you can look at the balanced equation and figure that out can't you in fact you see that since the hydrogen has a coefficient that's three times what nitrogen is it's safe to say that hydrogen is being depleted three times as fast as the nitrogen is and so that makes sense the hydrogen is shooting down looks like about three times faster than the nitrogen the last question I have for you here is why is there more hydrogen than ammonia at equilibrium and some students have a little trouble with this because you might expect that the this ammonia since it's the product it should be like way up here at the end but that's not always how it's going to be there is just there evidently was just so much hydrogen and we're just not going to make that much ammonia in this process that as it turns out we're going to have some excess hydrogen we're going to have more hydrogen than we have ammonia so in a chemical reaction don't always expect there to be a whole lot of product and then the reactants are all depleted to almost zero it's not always going to be the case it's okay for there to be not as much U product as there is some of the reactant that's that's okay so as you look at this this process here I hope you're able to uh to see a nice introduction to equilibrium if you learned something from this video If you appreciated something from this please hit that Thumbs Up Button I'm Jeremy kug I've been teaching AP

Calculating the Equilibrium Constant 03:15  Section 7.5, Magnitude of the Equilibrium Constant",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkC0mQwKM1c&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=68,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this video we're going to be continuing with unit 7 this time sections four and five I've been teaching AP Chemistry for 24 years and I want to make sure that you get the score you want to get on the AP exam so make sure that you're subscribed that way you don't miss a thing and hit that Thumbs Up Button if you learn something from my videos I would really appreciate it well in section four we're going to be learning about how to calculate an equilibrium constant now we just barely touched on in the last section but we'll try another example with this here's another reaction it says for the reaction shown here at 300 Kelvin a mixture of N2 and O2 react and are allowed to attain equilibrium at equilibrium n equal 1.22 * 10 the5th molar while N2 and O2 are both 1.00 molar calculate the equilibrium constant KC at 300 Kelvin so once again the first thing we have to do is write the equilibrium constant expression for this reaction so just like we learned in the last video it's products over reactant raised to the power of the coefficient so that's going to be KC equals concentration of n^ 2ar all over ns2 * O2 concentration so now once we have that expression written now we can just plug and chug and solve for the KC so n o is given to us here in the problem as 1.22 * 105 and of course we have to square that in the denominator we have N2 and O2 and those are both given to us as 1.0 molar so I will plug both of those in and now we just key this into our calculator and we should get an answer that KC equals 1.49 * 10 -10th so that's the answer once again like we said in the last video equilibrium constants do not have units and so don't worry about trying to to get a unit out of that because well there are none now one detail about this that I want to point out to you that I didn't mention in the last video notice the temperature some students get caught up on this temperature here we have 300 Kelvin and some people think we got to do something with that we don't have to worry about that the reason that temperature is in the problem is to confirm that the equilibrium constant is what it is okay because an equilibrium constant is only valid for a reaction at a specific temperature if you change the temperature you change the equilibrium constant and so if we were you know at maybe trying to calculate this at 350 Kelvin Well we'd have a different set of numbers here and these numbers would not work so that's why they they throw that temperature in there not to confuse you just to let you know that we are confirming that that this equilibrium will actually be the right constant so that's how you solve for an equilibrium constant just basically plug and chug into the equation now in section five we're going to talk about what the meaning of the equilibrium constant is because we worked an example in this video and we also worked an example in the last video you might remember that we have we had two equilibrium constants that were very different from each other sometimes we'll have a very large equilibrium constant uh in the last example in fact I'll just pull this up again you might notice that this equilibrium constant was a very small number 10 Theus 10th is an extremely small number well in the last video we had a large equilibrium constant now what I mean by large is it's much larger than one so maybe something like a 100 or larger than that well if you have a very large number that means that we have a relatively large number in the numerator because products are written on top and a relatively smaller number in the denominator because reactants are written on the bottom so that means we have a lot of product and not much reactant that that's what it means if you have a very large number like we had in the the last video in chemistry sometimes we say that equilibrium lies to the right if that's the case lies to the right and why do we say that well when you write out an equation you always write the products on the right side of the arrow so that's just kind of a little um I guess a secret code or like a little U way of saying that equilibrium lies to the right now in the example that we just did you will recall that we had a very small equilibrium constant something like 10 Theus 10th if you ever have a very small equilibrium constant like you know 10 minus 2 you know 01 or or smaller than that I'd call that fairly small that means that you're going to have a lot of reactant and not much product and we say that's the case because you know if you don't have a whole lot of product that means the product is written in the numerator and that's going to be a small number and the reactants are written in the denominator and that's a relatively large number so that means that when you divide it out you have a small number so in that case we'd say equilibrium lies to the left and and hopefully that makes sense because when you write an equal uh when you write a balanced equation rather you always write the reactants on the left side of the arrow so that denotes that you have a lot of reactants not much product if we take a look at these two numbers that we worked with earlier uh here was the example that we did just a couple minutes ago a very small equilibrium constant if you look back at the problem you'll see indeed we had a lot of reactant but the product concentration was very small like 10us 5th or something like that compared to 1.0 in the case of the reactants if you look back to the notes from the last video if you have your workbook or you you can watch that video again I suppose you can see that in that other example we had a lot of product not much reactant left over so that's why we had a very large number for the equilibrium constant hope you learned something about the the the meaning of the equilibrium constant and also how to work these problems if you learned something please slam that Thumbs Up Button join me in the next video in unit 7 section six where we're going to learn how to manipulate reactions and how that changes the equilibrium constant I'm Jeremy Krug join me in that next video thanks

"Manipulating Reactions and Its Effect on the Equilibrium Constant - AP Chem Unit 7, Topic 6","#apchem #equilibriumchemistry #equilibriumconstant   In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how equilibrium constants are affected when a chemical reaction is manipulated.  Three changes are discussed:  flipping (or reversing) a chemical reaction, multiplying a reaction by a coefficient, and adding two reactions together.  00:00  Introduction 00:15  Reversing a Chemical Equation 01:34  Multiplying a Reaction by a Coefficient 02:35  Adding Two Reactions Together 04:16  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4adSYN8tMM&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=69,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to be taking a look at unit 7 section six which is about what happens to equilibrium Constance whenever we manipulate or change a chemical reaction in some way now there are three things that we could do here here's a very typical chemical reaction that we've looked at before the formation of ammonia and it looks like the equilibrium constant K C at 500° CI is18 so if that's the case let's determine the value of KC for this reaction at the same temperature now you might notice that this reaction looks pretty similar to the first one doesn't it in fact the only thing that's been done is we have flipped that equation around the reactants are the products and the products are the reactants so how is that going to affect the value of KC well it's going to cause it to be the reciprocal of what it was originally and I hope that makes sense because an equilibrium constant is products over reactants if you flipped the position of the products and the reactants well you've just basically gotten the reciprocal so we have to take the reciprocal of what we originally had 1 divided .18 and in your calculator you'll find that the value of KC here for this new reaction is about 5.6 so once again if you flip a reaction around you have to take the reciprocal of the original equilibrium constant now another way that we can manipulate a reaction is by taking a reaction this is the same one that we just had and we can multiply that reaction that entire equation by a factor so in this case we've just multiplied the entire equation by a factor of two the original coefficients were 1 3 and two in the new equation our coefficients are 2 six and four everything has been doubled essentially so what we have to do here is since we've multiplied all the the coefficients by a factor of two we're going to raise the original equilibrium constant to a power of two so when you key this into your calculator the answer is you know 8^ squar it's 0.032 so once again if you multiply an equation by a factor you're going to raise the original equilibrium constant to whatever that numerical factor is now there's one other thing that we can do to a chemical equation in fact this is something that we can do to two chemical equations we can actually add them together and so in this example here we have two reactions that have these equilibrium constants at a certain temperature these are two distinct separate chemical reactions and these are the equilibrium constants with that information we're going to determine the value of KC for this third reaction at the same temperature of course so what we're going to do is notice that the first two equations add up to give us the third equation we can see that because the carbons will cancel out on either side of the arrow as well as these methane molecues they will cancel out on either side of the arrow as well leaving us with basically the two equations that add up to give us the final one so if that's the case all we have to do is take these two original equilibrium constants and multiply them by each other so this looks kind of like something that we did in hess's law back in unit uh six not quite the same thing although the the the idea is is somewhat similar so when you key this into your calculator 51.8 * 1.21 * 10 -3rd we we find that the new equilibrium constant for this reaction is 0627 so once again if two equations add up to get you a third equation you can multiply those original equilibrium constants together to get the new constant so I hope you learned something in this video I'm Jeremy kug I've been teaching AP Chemistry for 24 years and I hope uh I'm able to help you to get the AP score that you want on that exam in the next video video we're going to be starting in on unit 7 section 7 which is much longer it's about how to solve equilibrium problems bring your calculator I hope to see you then,"3,489",0,69
"Equilibrium Practice Problems - The ICE Box Method - AP Chem Unit 7, Topic 7a","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to solve equilibrium problems using the ICE (or RICE) box method, using the information you know in a problem to solve for the information you don't know.  He works several different types of equilibrium problems and focuses on the most common types of equilibrium problems presented in general chemistry classes. 00:00  Introduction 00:20  The ICE Box Method 01:56  Example Problem No 1 09:32  Example Problem No 2 15:14  Example Problem No 3 20:21  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYfMZulypc&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=70,hi there my name is Jeremy kug and in this video we're going to move on with AP Chemistry unit 7 section 7 which is all about how to solve equilibrium problems if you haven't subscribed to my channel yet go ahead and consider subscribing that way you won't miss a thing and you'll have your entire AP Chemistry course right here available to you well whenever we talk about how to solve equilibrium problems often we are given some initial concentrations uh we're often asked to solve for the final concentration these of course might be pressures in the case of a KP problem and sometimes all of these numbers can be very overwhelming especially if you have four five maybe six uh reactants and products to keep straight and you have all these numbers you have to keep the mo ratio straight so this this can get very confusing and very overwhelming if you're not careful so I strongly recommend that you use a very organized meth method of working these problems my opinion is use what I call an ice box now when I say ice what that means is you're you're going to write the reaction from left to right and right underneath it you're going to write the letters i c and IC ice stands for initial change equilibrium and so you're going to write the initial concentration or pressure for every single substance in that equation you'll have a a row for the change and you'll have a row for the the equilibrium now the idea here is write down what you are given in the problem and then you're going to use what you know to solve for what you don't know so it's kind of like solving a puzzle in some ways because that's basically how something like a crossword puzzle or sodoku will work you use what you know to solve for what you don't know so we're going to to work several problems together in this video so that by the time you get to the end of this video you should feel pretty comfortable solving equilibrium problems with the ice boox method here's the first one it says that that a mixture of 020 moles of n .10 moles of H2 and 020 moles of water is is placed into a 2.0 L container at 280 Kelvin and the following reaction occurs and there's our balanced equation at equilibrium the concentration of no equal 060 moles per liter calculate the equilibrium concentrations of no H2 and water and calculate KC so once again I'm going to write that equation just like it it is given to me in the problem and over here on the left I'm going to write ice I stands for initial concentration C stands for change in the concentration and E stands for the equilibrium concentration now up here in the the first part of the problem it actually gives me the information or or tells me what I need to know in order to fill in the initial concentration for all these substances it says that for n just as an example we have 020 moles in a 2 L container now marity is moles divided by liters so that means that the marity of n starting out is10 molar and we can do the same thing h210 moles of H2 in that 2 lit container we'll have a concentration of 0.05 molar it also gives us the information to calculate the marity of water it says .20 moles of water is placed in that 2 L container so that means that its concentration is also1 molar now notice noce that the problem doesn't come right out and tell us how much nitrogen we have at the beginning but I think that based upon the fact that it doesn't tell us how much we have it's safe to say that that value is zero it's zero because if you are are told what you're given at the beginning and it doesn't tell you how much in two we can assume it's zero it's like for example if I have some marbles in my pocket and I say that I have three red marbles and three blue marbles and three white marbles in my pocket uh what are the odds or the probability of pulling out a purple marble from my pocket well I didn't say I had any purple marbles in my pocket that did I so since I didn't say that we can assume it's zero so it's it's kind of the same thing here if it doesn't tell us how much of something we have initially it's safe to assume that it's zero so that's why I'm plugging the zero in there now there's one other nugget of information that the problem gives us it says that is 060 molar so for that uh section here under equilibrium no o I'm going to plug in 060 now if I'm reading the problem correctly that is all that the problem has given me I have to use just this information to solve for everything else for every other blank in this ice box but I think I can do it because I know that the difference between1 and 0.006 is a loss of 0.004 so here for the change Row for n o I can fill in .04 molar and guess what h two is going to have the same change as well because it's a 2:2 mole ratio and since the mole ratio is the same the substances are used up at the same rate so if this one is is minus 04 this one is also going to be minus .04 as well now if the reactants are going down the products have to be going up so the the values on the right side will be plus something now N2 I want you to notice that the mole ratio is 2 to one two n O's for one N2 so that means whatever the change is for n o the absolute value is going to be half that for N2 so if this is a 0.004 this is going to be a 0.02 because it's half the coefficient but it's on the other side of the arrow so this is plus 02 what do you think water's change is going to be well take a look at that mole ratio it's 2 to two so that means its absolute value is the same if this one was 0.004 that's going to be 004 as well but since it's a product it's going up in value so this is going to be plus .04 now here in this first example I'm going slower as we do more of these I'll I'll I'll start to speed up so that you can kind of get the hang of this now as we solve for the equilibrium concentrations we just do our simple arithmetic here 05 minus 04 gets us 001 molar for hydrogen for nitrogen of course that's 02 molar and then water .100 plus 004 will be4 molar so we've answered the first part of the question we've actually calculated the equilibrium concentrations of all these other three substances now we just have to calculate KC now the way to do that is we have to first of all write the equilibrium constant expression just like we did in our earlier video about that so it's products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficients so that KC is going to be equal to N2 concentration time H2O squared because there's a two up there as it's coefficient over n^ 2 * H2 2ar and now all we have to do to find KC is plug these numbers these equilibrium values into that constant expression that we just wrote so the N2 is going to be 02 the water is 0.14 and that's going to be squared all over n o That's 006 which has to be squared and hydrogen's concentration is 01 and that has to be squared so you can key these numbers into your calculator and you should get an answer of 1.1 * 10 the 3r and so that is the equilibrium constant for this reaction at this temperature notice that we were able to solve for this using just the information that was given to us in the problem there wasn't a whole lot given to us but we were able to solve for that let's try another example now this one might be a little bit more complex yet it says for the reaction I2 gas plus br2 gas yields 2 ibr gas KC equals 280 at 150° C suppose that .5 moles of ibr in a 2 L flask is allowed to reach equilibrium at 150° C what are the equilibri concentrations of ibr I2 and br2 so we're going to do the same thing here we're going to write out the equation just like that and I'm going to put ice along the side here that stands for initial change and equilibrium so now we're going to plug in the numbers given to us in the problem let's see here it says that we're starting out with 0500 moles of ibr in a 2 L flat so when you divide that out moles divided by liters we get that the initial concentration of ibr will be .250 moles per liter now the problem doesn't tell us how much I2 and how much br2 we're starting with so guess what it's safe to assume we have zero right just like the the purple marbles example that I gave you earlier zero and zero for those now does the information inform in the problem give us anything else I don't think it gives us anything else other than the equilibrium constant so we're going to have to do some algebra here we know that you can't have a concentration below zero so I2 is going to have to go up but by how much does it go up well we don't know do we well if you don't know in algebra we call it X don't we so this is going to go up by X so that's our our change if we don't know any equilibrium concentrations or pressures we have to use x it's an unknown so I2 is a plus X br2 is kind of the same thing we don't know by how much it's going to go up we do know that it's going to go up by the same amount that I2 will increase by and that's because it's a one: one mole ratio so BR r2's change will also be plus X how about ibr well it's going to be 2x isn't it because the the mole ratio is one to one to two but notice we're on the uh the other side of the arrow here so this is going to be not plus 2X but minus 2x if one side of the uh reaction increases the other side of the reaction has to decrease so those are our change values and for equilibrium all that we can write right now will be x x and 250 - 2x so now we're going to plug these values into our equilibrium constant expression now we haven't written that yet but let's go ahead and write that KC equals the concentration of ibr quantity squared all over the concentration of I2 times the concentration of br2 just like we've done this before products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficients now we're going to plug in these values the problem tells us what KC is it's 280 so I can plug that in and that equals 250 minus 2X and that's quantity squar all over x^ SAR now if you're trying to solve this algebra problem how would you solve that well I notice that I have a squared quantity on top and a squared quantity on bottom so why don't I just take the square root of both sides of this equation now if I do that that's going to give me the square < TK of 280 which is 16.73% = 250 - 2x and now I can add 2x to both sides I'm basically I was trying to solve for x here so that gives me 18.73% answer the question let's find out the equilibrium concentrations of all three of these substances now the first one was I2 and you might recall that its equilibrium value was just equal to X so that's just 0133 moles per liter and br2 was the same way now ibr was actually 250 minus 2 * X so when you evaluate that expression you you find that ib's equilibrium concentration is 223 molar so there we have a fairly straightforward way to solve for all these equilibrium concentrations let's try one more problem this one's a little bit different it says at 400 Kelvin a chemist adds NBR gas into a sealed flask until its partial pressure is 050 atmosphere the gas decomposes according to the following equation and we have our equation there at equilibrium the total pressure in the flask is 600 atmospheres determine the equilibrium pressures of all three substances in the reaction and calculate KP for this reaction at 400 Kelvin so once again we're going to write out the equation write out the reaction there and we're going to have an ice box here and we're going to plug in now notice this time it's talking about KP so we're not looking at concentrations we're looking at pressures right the P stands for pressures now it says that the initial pressure of no o is 0500 atmosphere so I'm going to plug that in for the initial slot for no o now does the problem tell us how much n or br2 we're starting with no so what can we assume it's initial pressure is going to be well it has to be zero right like the purple marbles example if it the problem says we're just adding no o so it's safe to say there's nothing else in there now does the problem tell us anything else does the problem give us any equilibrium pressures well you can read and it actually says nothing about that now it does tell us that the total pressure in the flask is 6 atmospheres we're actually going to use that here in a second but it doesn't give us any individual equilibrium pressures does it so we're going to have to use that X business again so no o is going to have to go down and since there's a coefficient of two let's call this minus 2x on the other side of the arrow n o this is going to increase isn't it it's going to go up by the same amount because it's a 2:2 ratio so we're going to call this Plus 2X and bromine is also going to increase but it's not 2x this time is it it's half of that because it's a 2: one ratio so this is just plus X so our equilibrium pressures are 05 - 2x 2X and X now how do we solve the problem from here well there's a clue in this line right here it says at equilibrium the total pressure in the flask is 600 atmospheres so what that means is that if I take these three Expressions here this 050 minus 2X and the 2X and the X and I add those together that's equal to 60 so we actually have this expression that is a true statement we have a little algebra problem here and all we have to do is solve for x and that's not too hard in fact the - 2x and the plus 2X kind of cancel out and we have x +5 = 6 we just subtract 0.5 from both sides and we find that x equal 0.1 now if you plug that 0.1 back in for X in each of these here we find that n o you know 05 - 2x is3000 atmospheres the nitrogen monox oxide is 2x so that's .200 atmospheres and the bromine is just X which is. 1 0 atmospheres we can double check this and you'll notice that if you add these three pressures to each other we do indeed have a total of 600 atmospheres don't we so it does work out mathematically now the problem also asks us to calculate KP at this temperature so we're going to have to write the expr EX for KP do you remember how to do that it's products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficients now it's not marity it's not brackets it's written like this with the with those P's in there for partial pressure it's pressure of n squar times the pressure of bromine all over the pressure of no o quantity squared so now we can just plug these numbers into that expression right there the no o is uh 0.2 and that has to be squared the bromine is 0.1 and the no o is3 and we have to square that so when you evaluate this on your calculator you know. 2^ 2ar * 0.1 divided. 3^ 2 you find that the answer 4.4 * 10 -2 uh I hope you have learned something about how to solve equilibrium problems there's a lot going on here this was a little bit longer video than most if you learned something please smash that

"Working With Very Small Equilibrium Constants - The 5% Rule - AP Chem Unit 7, Topic 7b #apchem","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to simplify the mathematics in equilibrium problems with very small equilibrium constants.  This method is sometimes called the 5% rule.  He works several equilibrium example problems in the video. 00:00  Introduction 00:29  Example Problem No 1 06:51  When Can You Use the 5% Rule? 08:39  Example Problem No 1 12:49  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq4_DGACaDE&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=71,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this AP Chemistry video we're going to be taking a look at unit 7 section 7 which is about solving equilibrium problems but in this video specifically what you can do if you have a very small equilibrium constant uh there are some things that you can do to make your math a lot easier if you're not subscribed yet consider subscribing that way you'll have the entire AP Chemistry curriculum here at your fingertips along with review videos and problem walkthroughs and all kinds of great stuff uh let's take a look at this problem here it says at 600 Kelvin a chemist places 1.00 mole of sulfur trioxide gas into a 1.00 l container and the reaction below takes place after the reaction attains equilibrium what will be the concentration of all three substances and we have our balanced equation and then then the equilibrium constant is given to us as well very small numbers we can see so as you can see I have an ice box set up just like like we learned about in the last video that stands for initial change and equilibrium so does the problem tell us the initial concentration of sulfur trioxide we can figure that out can't we one mole divided one lit that's 1.0 molar for our concentration of SO3 now it doesn't tell us what the initial concentrations of our other substances are right so we can call those zero like I said in the last video if it doesn't tell us what the initial concentration of a substance is it's safe to assume that it's zero now it doesn't give us any other information does it so we're going to have to do X right so instead of having an equilibrium value to do our math from we're just going to have to say that that the change in sulfur trioxide is a minus 2x because it has to go down this other side side the product side has to go up and SO2 is going to be plus 2X since it's a 2:2 mole ratio now oxygen is going to go up as well but only by 1 x isn't it since it's a 2:1 ratio so that's a plus X so in our equilibrium row here we have 1 - 2x 2X and x and so this is the point as we saw in the last video where we're going to plug these values into our equilibrium constant expression with which looks something like this products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficients now we're going to plug and chug into that equation and we get you know KC is 5.9 * 10 the 9th equal 2x^ 2ar * X all over 1 - 2x^ 2ar and it looks like we know that 2x^2 * X is actually 4X x cubed on the bottom we can use the foil method here to evaluate what that is equal to but as you can see we have a little problem uh we are starting to get a very messy algebra problem here and we could solve this using I suppose whatever methodology you might use for solving a cubic equation but it's a messy problem this is something that we like to avoid so in chemistry we have a rule and it's called the 5% Rule now let me show you how this works and I'll tell you why it's called the 5% rule here in just a minute hopefully at this point you will realize that since this equilibrium constant is a very small number you know 10 Theus 9th a very very small number that means that almost none of this one molar sulfur trioxide is going to react so that means that 1 - 2x is very very close close to one and so because of that I think it's safe for me to just ignore this minus 2x right here and we can work the problem without that that that subtracted term there and we should get an answer that is extremely close to the real answer so let's go ahead and work the problem by ignoring this minus 2x so once again when I plug this into the equilibrium constant expression this time I get the equilibrium constant equals 2x^ 2ar * X all over 1^ SAR and all of a sudden this makes the problem a whole lot easier doesn't it I can cross multiply and of course I have 4X cubed in that uh term there I can divide both sides by four and then I can use pretty much any scientific calculator to take the cube root of 1.48 * 10 9th and I find that X is equal to about 1.1 * 10 the -3rd now let's double check and make sure that this is is actually appropriate to do what I want to do is take whatever that term was that I subtracted or was going to subtract the the minus 2X and let's divide that by what it was going to be subtracted from to make sure that it's less than 5% because this only works works if that subtracted value that you're ignoring is less than about 5% so 2x would be well twice that number and then divide it by 1. and then times it by 100 so yes this is much less than 5% it's. 22% so it's okay to do that now let's go ahead and plug these numbers into the expression here and find find out what our equilibrium concentrations are so in the case of sulfur trioxide it's 1 - 2x so if I take one and then subtract two times that x value I get an answer of n98 molar so my assumption was correct that that equilibrium concentration is pretty close to one isn't it it doesn't go down by much then sulfur dioxide is 2x so 2 * that x value will be 2.2 * 10us 3r molar and then oxygen is just equal to X so that's just 1.1 * 10 the -3rd molar and we got to solve this problem without having to solve any cubic roots or quadratic equation or some other uh fairly uh complex mathematical method now this is called the 5% Rule and the reason that it's called that is because we can ignore that subtra raction or or that subtracted term as long as that term is less than 5% of what it's being subtracted from that's why I did that little extra step there after uh solving for x because if for some reason you know that value ended up being more than 5% well then I would have had to start all over and actually use a you know use cubic roots or quadratic equation or or some other method to solve for X now this method Works usually very well with equilibrium constants that are smaller than about 1 * 105th so if you have equilibrium constants larger than that like times 10 the -4 uh sometimes you're kind of on the bubble sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't if you're in that range of 1 * 10 the -3rd this is probably not going to work um but this works usually pretty best for significantly small equilibrium constants now uh in general chemistry in college sometimes they will have you actually have values greater than 5% in which you'll have to actually use some other complex mathematical method to solve for x but I do have some good news if you're taking this class as an AP course in high school you are never going to be asked to use the quadratic formula or some other complex method like cubic roots or quartic roots or something like that to solve for X the 5% rule is going to work as long as you have that small equilibrium constant so yes that is going to work so let's take a look at another example here this one says that in air nitrogen and oxygen gases react slightly forming nitrogen monoxide gas if the partial pressure of nitrogen is 78 atmospheres and oxygen is. 21 atmospheres what will be the partial pressure of all three substances after the reaction so there's our balanced equation and we notice that our our equilibrium constant is an exceedingly small number you know times 10 the - 31st that is very very small so I feel very confident that the 5% rule is going to work here so let's set up our ice box and nitrogen its partial pressure is 78 so I'll plug that in Oxygen's partial pressure is. 21 atmospheres and the no o is not given to us so that means that initially it is going to be information does it so that means that our change is going to be minus X Min - x and the n o is going to be + 2x isn't it because we're on the the other side of the arrow so it's got to go up instead of going down and there's that uh 1:2 ratio so that's why it's 2x so our equilibrium values are going to be 78 minus x 21 - x and 2x so now I can plug these values into the equilibrium constant expression I have to write that don't I because that's not given to me here so it's KP so KP equals the partial pressure of N squared all over the partial pressure of nitrogen time the partial pressure of oxygen so now I can plug these values in I'm I have the KP given to me in the problem here the n o is a 2X and that's quantity squared all over 78 - x and 21 - x you might notice that if I were to use the foil method and you know foil this out we would have a very complex math problem again wouldn't and we we try to avoid that so we're going to use the 5% Rule and we're going to ignore that minus X and we're also going to ignore this other minus X so by doing that now I can cross multiply over here of course this is 4x^2 when I cross multiply I end up getting 4x^2 = 7.13 * 10 -32 and I can divide both sides by four to get x^2 = 1.78 * 10- 32nd and now I can take the square root of both sides to find that X is 1.3 * 10 -16th now I am very sure that that value for x is is much less than 5% of either of these values it would be subtracted from 0. 21 or or 78 but let's just double check just to make sure so I'll I'll divide that by one of the values I'll use the the the smaller one there and I end up finding it's like you know 6.4 * 10us 14% so exceedingly small amount of this stuff gets reacted so yeah that's uh way less than 5% so now I can plug these back into the Expressions here into if you take your calculator and take 78 minus that x value your calculator is just going to say 78 it doesn't really understand a difference between those two numbers in most cases for most calculators anyway your O2 the same thing if you try to subtract it it's just 0. 21 so that's that's fine now your n o is 2X and so you have to times this by two and so your your no o concentration or or that pressure rather becomes 2.6 * 10- 16th atmospheres I've been teaching chemistry for 24 years I hope you're able to use my knowledge and help you raise your AP score if you haven't subscribed yet go ahead and subscribe if you would and hit that thumbs up button that really does help the algorithm I do appreciate it and I hope to see you in the next video where we're going to move on to AP Chemistry unit 7 section 8 thanks for watching,"3,284",0,71

taking a look at AP Chemistry unit 7 section nine which is all about what happens when you have a system at equilibrium and then you disturb that equilibrium by the way if you haven't subscribed yet consider subscribing because that way you'll have instant access to the entire AP Chemistry curriculum here on my channel as well as some great review videos and problem walkthroughs and all kinds of good stuff now when we talk about disturbing a system at equilibrium this is later's principle that helps us to understand this it basically says that anytime you have a system at equilibrium and that system is Disturbed the system is going to shift itself in order to counteract that disturbance and it's going to return to equilibrium now in order to illustrate this let's take a look at the same thought experiment that we looked at way back in section one of this unit and that is the dance floor problem you might remember if you're following along with these videos that we had a a dance maybe it's a prom homecoming or something and there were 300 people uh at this dance and we found that after every song 30% of the people who were dancing sat down and likewise after every song 20% of the people who weren't dancing got up and started dancing so once we did that for a few songs we found that there was an equilibrium where pretty much no matter what happened 30% of 119 is 36 and 20% of 181 is also 36 and so you have a net change of zero and so for all practical purposes as long as this dance continues you'll always have 119 people on the dance floor and 181 people that are not dancing well what happens if we throw some party crashers into the mix so once again we're going to disturb the Dance Floor equilibrium and we do that by throwing 30 party crashers now when party crashers show up usually they they will show up on the not dancing side like we said in the last video people as they walk into the gymnasium or into the building are not dancing their way into the building usually that's not how it works and so we're going to put the 30 party crashers on the not dancing side now this changes things doesn't it because 30% of 119 is still 36 but 20% of 211 is actually 42 so notice we have a net change of positive six in the direction of the dance floor so the Dance Floor goes up by six and the not dancing side goes down by six and we can do this again 30% of 125 is 38 and 20% of 205 is 4 41 so after the next song we have a net change of plus three in the Dance Floor goes up to 128 the not dancing side goes down uh to 202 and we do it again you know 38 and 40 this time after this song it's a net change of plus two in the direction of the dance floor so the Dance Floor goes up to 130 and the not dancing side goes down to 200 we can do this again you know 30% of 130 39 20% of 200 is 40 so we have a net change of plus one in the direction of the dance floor so this goes to 131 the not dancing side goes down to 199 and we can do it again the 30% of 131 is 39 20% of 199 is 40 so once again it's a plus one in the direction of the dance floor like this and watch what happens happens now if we take 30% of that 132 we get 40 and 20% of our 198 is 40 so guess what we are back at dance floor equilibrium and we have a net change of zero so it's still 132 and 198 and of course we could do this again and you'd notice that the numbers stay the same so let's analyze what happened here in our revised Dance floor problem with the party crashers what was the eventual effect of throwing an additional 30 people onto this not dancing side well after that change took place after that disturbance or that disruption took place notice that the side where we added the party crashers to actually went down and it actually caused an increase in the other side of the process now guess what the same thing happens when we add substances in a chemical reaction if we have uh any reaction at equilibrium and when you add a substance it actually causes an increase in the other side of the reaction so for example if we have this balanced equation right here and it's at equilibrium and everything seems like it's uh fairly stable but all of a sudden we decide to add some hydrogen sulfide gas into the mix well guess what it's going to cause the carbon disulfide and the hydrogen gases to increase while the methane and the hydrogen sulfide will decrease after that change now what if you do it to the other side well same type of idea if we decide to add some carbon disulfide instead to this process at equilibrium well we're going to cause methane and hydrogen sulfide gases to increase and then the carbon disulfide and hydrogen gases would decrease so you add a substance it causes an increase in the other side of the reaction and of course the side where you added it is going to have to go down in in order to make that other side increase now when a substance is removed it causes an increase on the same side of the reaction so this is kind of the converse of what we saw in that other example so if you have this process at equilibrium and you decide to remove some carbon disulfide well it's going to cause that equilibrium to shift farther to the right and you'll make more carbon disulfide and more hydrogen and the the methane and the hydrogen sulfide will go down likewise if you have this at equilibrium and instead you decide to remove some methane well the equilibrium is going to shift in order to replace replenish the methane so the methane will increase hydrogen sulfide will increase and then the two other things here CS2 and hydrogen will go down that's why by the way in Industry whenever they are making a product maybe in this process they're trying to make I don't know Carbon disulfide or something well what they're going to do is as it's created they're going to try to remove that carbon disulfide from the mix that way that equilibrium keeps shifting so that it replenishes and keeps producing that carbon disulfide and of course if you're in Industry you're you're trying to make more of the product so that's what you're going to do now there are some things that do not affect equilibrium at all things like adding an inert gas and when I say inert gas I'm talking about any gas that doesn't really participate in that chemical reaction has no effect on it so for example if we had this and we decided to add some random gas like neon or nitrogen or something it's not going to have any effect on that reaction equilibrium and likewise adding a catalyst does not affect equilibrium in unit five we talked about how adding a catalyst speeds up a reaction we talked about how it does that but it doesn't shift or affect equilibrium whatsoever so let's take a look at this process here and let's find out what's going to happen to the concentration of carbon dioxide gas if each of the following changes is made when it is at equilibrium so what happens if we add oxygen gas well we're adding oxygen so it's going to shift it in the other direction so that means carbon dioxide along with water vapor are going to increase aren't they what's GNA happen if we add water vapor however well if we add water vapor it's going to cause the reaction to shift in the other direction so we'll make more oxygen right but we're going to decrease the water and the carbon dioxide it will go down and hopefully that makes sense because if you add water it's going to have to react with some of that carbon dioxid which means it's going to have to go down isn't it how about adding octane to the reaction mixture what's going to happen if we add octane the answer is no change now why is that well this was not intended to intended to be a trick question sometimes it it might have been I don't know but octane is a liquid and since it is a liquid it has no effect on equilibrium so octane as a liquid is not even a part of that equilibrium mixture how about removing some water vapor from the reaction mixture well if you remove water vapor it's going to shift in order to replenish that water vapor so we're going to make more water we're going to make more carbon dioxide as well aren't we so it's going to increase what about if we remove oxygen gas well if remove oxygen gas the reaction is going to try to replenish that isn't it so that means we're going to make more oxygen we're going to have the carbon dioxide in water go down so it's going to decrease so that's what happens how about adding some Argon gas to the reaction vessel well argon's not even in this reaction is it so the answer is no change now there are some other things we can do to a reaction mixture one thing we can do is change the pressure inside the reaction V vessel now the easiest way to to change the pressure of the vessel is to change the volume if you want to increase the pressure you just you know decrease the volume you smash it down where it's smaller if you increase the volume that's going to decrease the pressure now the way this works is if you have a reaction and you increase the pressure by decreasing the volume it's going to shift the equilibrium toward the side that has fewer moles of gas and that would be the reactant side in this particular reaction because we have 1 plus 2 which is three moles of gas on the reactant side whereas on the product side we have 1 + 4 or five moles of gas and since three moles of gas take up less space than five moles of gas when you decrease the volume it's going to shift toward the side that takes up less space space so that would be the the reactant side in this particular reaction on the other hand if you increase the volume which is the same as decreasing the pressure essentially it's going to shift toward the side that has more moles of gas because that's the side that takes up more space you increase your your your space you're going to uh increase the amount of stuff and in and basically occupy that space so it's going to shift toward the the right in this case so let's try this example again we have that same reaction what's going to happen if we increase the pressure so that's decreasing the volume well it's going to go toward the side that has fewer moles of gas so we have 25 moles of gas versus about 34 so it's going to shift toward the left side that means carbon dioxide will go down it will decrease likewise if we decrease the pressure it's it's going to go toward the side that has more moles of gas because that's the side that takes up more space so carbon dioxide along with water vapor would increase if you uh carried out that change so you can add materials you can take materials away you can change the pressure what else can you do to assist them at equilibrium well there's only one other thing that I can think of and that's changing the temperature now this is really the only way to change the actual equilibrium constant we talked about that earlier in this unit if you change the temperature then you are changing the equilibrium constant but you're also changing the direction in which it's going to go so here's that same reaction uh once again this time but this time I'm giving you Delta H and why am I doing that well it makes a difference in this case this reaction is exothermic in fact it's very exothermic it gives off 11,000 K per mole in that reaction so since it's exothermic that means heat is a product isn't it so I can actually write plus heat as a product raising the temperature is the same as adding heat isn't it so if I raise the temperature I'm essentially adding a product and it's going to shift equally ibrium back toward the side of the reactants so I'm going to make more oxygen I'll make more reactants at the expense of the products now the other uh case is true as well if you lower the temp temperature that's the same thing as removing heat isn't it so if you lower the temperature you take away heat and it's going to make carbon dioxide and water at the expense of the reactants that you have present present there now if the reaction had been endothermic heat would be a reactant so it would be the opposite of all those things we'll actually see an example of that here in a moment so let's try a couple examples in fact this one actually is an an endothermic reaction and the question says what's going to happen if we do all of these things how about increase the temperature increase the temperature well let's think about where heat is here this is an endothermic reaction since Delta H is positive postive so that means heat is a reactant and if we increase the temperature we're adding heat aren't we so it's going to cause the equilibrium to shift toward the right and we're going to make more carbon disulfide it's going to go up along with the hydrogen as well and of course if we decrease the heat it's the opposite we're taking away heat so we have to replenish that by using up the products there so CS2 is going to decrease here's another question which of the following changes is going to cause the actual equilibrium constant KC for that above reaction to increase now let's think about this if I want to cause the equilibrium constant to increase then I need to increase the amount of products I'm making right so how do I increase the amount of products I'm making and uh and I get rid of these these reactants over here well I can add a reactant right and the only reactant that's going to change the equilibrium constant is adding heat so if I add heat that's the same thing as increasing the temperature raising the temperature I'm going to cause more CS2 more H2 to form at the expense of these reactants over here the equilibrium constant goes up hope that makes sense to you hope you learn something about lat's principle and

"Reaction Quotient & Le Chatelier's Principle - AP Chem Unit 7, Topic 10","#apchem #apchemistry #equilibriumchemistry   In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to use the reaction quotient, Q, to determine whether or not a system is at equilibrium.  And if it's not at equilibrium, the reaction quotient can be used to determine if the reaction will proceed to the right (forming more products) or to the left (forming more reactants).  He works two examples and gives students a helpful mnemonic aid to remember the direction in which equilibrium will proceed.  00:00  Introduction 00:34  What Is the Reaction Quotient? 03:25  A

going to take a look at AP Chemistry unit 7 section 10 which is all about what happens if you have a mixture that's not necessarily at equilibrium how you can determine in which direction that mixture is going to go toward the reactants or toward the products and by the way if you haven't yet subscribed to my channel I'd like to encourage you to do that that way you'll have access to all of my 100 plus AP Chemistry videos instantly and you'll also have access to my AP review videos and problem walkthroughs and all kinds of good stuff well back to the the content here we can actually take a look at a non-equilibrium mixture and we can calculate something called its reaction quotient and we can then compare that reaction quotient to the equilibrium constant and we're going to see if that mixture is at equilibrium or if not in which direction it's going to go toward the uh toward the left or toward the right so let's see how this works Works let's say we have this problem right here where there's a flask that contains 4 mol nitrogen gas 50 molar hydrogen gas and 30 molar ammonia gas at 500° C and they're going to react according to that equation right there and we have an equilibrium constant so the question is is the mixture at equilibrium and if not in which direction is the mixture going to proceed what we have to do is take these concentrations here and plug them into the expression for the reaction quotient now just so you know the expression for the reaction quotient looks exactly the same as the expression for the equilibrium constant it it's it's still products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficients and so it looks exactly like the equilibrium constant expression would look the only difference is since we're not sure that it's at equilibrium we can't really call it K we have to call it q q is the reaction quotient so we're going to plug these numbers into that expression and looks like ammonia is 30 so that's going to have to be squared in the denominator it's nitrogen which is4 molar and then the hydrogen is .5 mol and that's going to be cubed so when you key these into your calculator 3 3^ 2 /4 / .5 cubed you'll find that the reaction quotient is 1.8 so now we see that we are not at equilibrium because the only way that you can be at equilibrium is if Q equals K and that's not the case so we're not at equilibrium so that answers the first question the second question says in which reaction will it proceeded well well here's how to keep this straight if Q equals K it's at equilibrium if Q is less than K the reaction is going to go toward the right and make more uh products and the reactants will go down if Q is greater than k then it's going to go to the left and you're going to make more reactants and the products will go down and so since Q is greater than k then that means it's going to go toward the left now some students in fact a lot of students have trouble keeping all that straight so here's what I do what I do is I take that that greater than sign in this case and I uh turn that into a little Pac-Man symbol like this and so that Pac-Man perhaps you've played that game before or you've seen it and you know that the Pac-Man is eating in the direction of going left and so that tells you that the reaction is going to go to to the left if the other way had been correct if Q had been less than k then the Pacman as you can see right there is going to be going toward the right and the Pac-Man is eating toward the right so if you use that Pac-Man symbol that hopefully will help you to keep all of this straight let's try another example we're we're going to use the same chemical equation here this time a two .0 L flask contains 96 moles of nitrogen gas 96 moles of hydrogen gas and .10 moles of ammonia gas at 500° C so this time the question says as the mixture reacts which substances will increase in concentration and which ones will decrease in concentration so same type of problem we're going to plug these concentrations values here into the Q or the reaction quotient expression products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficients so ammonia looks like ammonia is .10 / 2 L so that's .05 molar and that has to be squared in the denominator nitrogen is96 moles ided 2 L so that's 48 molar and then the hydrogen is also .96 moles / 2 L so that is 48 molar but this time it's cubed because there's a coefficient of three so when you compute this in your calculator you find that Q is equal to 0.047 so let's compare Q versus k q is less than K isn't it so do you remember in which direction the reaction is going to go well if you're not sure just draw in that Pacman there and you can see that that the Pac-Man is moving to the right you know he's going in this direction so that means that the reaction is going to proceed toward the right and that means that we're going to increase the amount of ammonia that's present and the amount of nitrogen and hydrogen are going to decrease I hope this video has helped you to understand uh how to work Q versus K problems and hopefully a nice Nifty way to remember uh how all this works and keep all this straight once again I hope you uh like my video If you learned something from this leave a comment down below uh that really helps the YouTube algorithm and I do appreciate it hope to see you in my

of solutions this is AP Chemistry unit 7 section 11 if you haven't already subscribed to my channel go ahead and consider doing that that way you'll have access to all 100 plus of my AP Chemistry daily videos as well as my AP review videos and problem walkthroughs and everything else so hope uh you can take advantage of that well so far in this course we've learned about equilibrium as we're learning about here in unit 7 we've learned about Solutions as well but in this video we're going to take those two concepts and put them together the equilibrium of solution chemistry now so far we have applied equilibrium to uh gases and some other things mostly gases well in this Solutions and how a saturated solution is also at equilibrium uh just for example example if you have a saturated solution of sodium chloride salt and you just keep pouring the salt in there and eventually it's holding as much uh sodium chloride as that solution can can dissolve well that saturated solution of sodium chloride is actually at equilibrium now we're going to apply this to some things that we normally consider to be insoluble you might remember those solubility rules that we looked at earlier in this course back in unit 4 and just as an example lead chloride lead 2 chloride is generally insoluble as you probably know but the fact is that a very small amount of even that insoluble compound can dissolve in water and we can use that amount to calculate an equilibrium constant for the dissolving of lead 2 chloride in water or for any other compound now in order to do that that we have to first of all write a balanced equation that describes the dissolving of lead to chloride and so the way that works is you write you know the lead to Chloride solid and there's an equilibrium there and it decomposes into lead 2+ ions aquous and two chloride ions aquous now we know that lead 2 chloride is not that soluble so this equilibrium is going to lie pretty far to the left here and you aren't going to have a whole lot of products and so you'd expect this equilibrium constant to be very small well we'll see how just how small that is here in a moment now we can write the equilibrium constant expression for that process it's the same way that we write an equilibrium constant expression for any reaction it's products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficients so PB 2 plus ions it's concentration times the marity of the chloride ions squared since there's a coefficient of two and that's equal to the K now I want you to notice that we have a new type of equilibrium constant this is not KC or KP we call this KSP and the SP in the KSP stands for solubility product so sometimes KSP is just referred to as the solubility product constant it's the same thing it's just a fancy way of saying K or KSP in this case now we're going to take that information here about lead 2 chloride and if we actually try to to dissolve that into water we find that at 25° C a maximum of 4.51 G of lead 2 chloride can be dissolved in one liter of solution so let's calculate first of all the the molar solubility of lead 2 chloride and then from that we're going to calculate the K or the KSP here for the lead to Chloride now notice that the solubility that's given to us in the problem is in grams per liter 4.51 G of lead 2 chloride per 1.00 L well the question says calculate the molar solubility all that means is just convert it to moles per liter regular solubility is G per liter molar solubility is moles per liter this is just a grams to moles conversion that's all you have to do so in our conversion factor we're going to put grams on the bottom so it'll cancel out and one mole on top and so at this point you just have to consult the periodic table to find the molar mass of lead to Chloride you know one lead atom and two chlorines gets you a total of 278.15 2 moles per liter that's the molar solubility of pbcl2 now we're going to take that information right here and move on to to Part B and calculate the KSP for Pb cl2 now in order to do this we need to think about the balanced equation and we just said that the concentration of the lead 2 chloride that can dissolve in water is 0162 moles per liter so if that's the case then the the concentration of lead that gets into solution is the same because it's a one to one ratio it's it's also 0162 moles per liter the chloride ion concentration is going to be twice that value do you see why it's a 1:2 ratio so it's it's twice it's 0324 moles per liter so now to find that equilibrium constant that KSP that we're trying to solve for we just have to plug those numbers into the appropriate spots in that little equation right there in that expression so just plug it in and when you key this into your calc calculator 0162 * 0324 2ar you find that the KSP for this is 1.4 * 10-5 and so this is a fairly small number just like we predicted it would be since lead to Chloride is is not that soluble to start with let's try another example the KSP for iron 2 sulfide is 8.0 * 10 -28 e write the equation for the dissociation of iron 2 sulfide in water write the equilibrium constant expression for this process calculate the molar solubility of iron 2 sulfide in water and calculate the solubility of iron 2 sulfide in grams per liter so there's a lot going on here so part A is just the equation of course we have to know how to write the formula for iron 2 sulfide that was way back in those introductory videos unit zero that FES and that's going to dissociate into fe2+ ions and sulfide S2 negative ions both those ions are aquous now Part B we're writing the equilibrium constant expression uh products over reactants raise the power of the coefficients notice that we don't have anything in the denominator because solids are not involved in this equilibrium constant expression just like it wasn't in in the case of lead to Chloride so your KSP expression looks just like this well let's go on to part C and calculate the molar solubility of iron 2 sulfide now in the last example we knew what that was so we could write that down here next to the in that case it was pbcl2 we don't know what the molar solubility is though we're trying to calculate it so since we don't know let's just call it X now if that is X then the iron 2+ ion concentration is also going to be X isn't it because it's a 1: one mole ratio and the sulfide is also X because it's a one: one mole ratio so now we're going to plug what we know into KSP expression here to solve for the unknown we're going to solve for x the KSP is given to us in the problem it's 8.0 time 10 -28 and we have those two x's to plug in for the iron ion concentration and the sulfide ion concentration so basically we have the equation x^2 = 8.0 * 10 -28 if we take the square root of both sides we find that x equals about 2.83 * 10 -14 and X as you can see back here is equal to the molar solubility so that's the molar solubility it's about 2.8 * 10 -14th moles per liter iron 2 sulfide so that's part C now Part D asks us to calculate the solubility now that's in grams per liter isn't it so all we have to do is take the the molar solubility and convert it to grams per liter so this is just a a mol to gam conversion just like we had earlier isn't it so that means that one mole has to go on the bottom Gams Will Go On Top we can look at the periodic table and find that the molar mass of Fes adds up to about 87.9 one if my calculations are correct we can cancel moles and now we just multiply across and we find that the solubility of this will be about 2.5 * 10 -12th grams per liter that is an exceedingly small amount isn't it so this is a very insoluble compound now take a look at the KSP value very small number 10 minus 28 that's an exceedingly small number isn't it so hopefully that helps us to see the significance of KSP the larger the value for KSP the more soluble that ionic compound is going to be so we had lead to Chloride earlier it was like 10 Theus 5 you could I mean you could dissolve a certain amount of of solid into that solution and you could actually see that but in the case of this last example led to sulfide it's that that KSP is exceedingly small so let's try two other examples which of these two compounds is more soluble well it's the one that has the larger KSP isn't it so that would be the barium sulfate in this case its KSP is much larger by a factor of uh 10 7th basically uh than zinc sulfide let's do one more example together and here is our reasoning of course more soluble because it's value for KSP is larger let's do one more example the KSP for magnesium fluoride is 5.16 * 10 11th write the equation for the the dissociation of magnesium fluoride in water write the equilibrium constant expression for for this process calculate the molar solubility of magnesium fluoride in water and calculate the solubility of this compound in grams per liter so once again just like in the last example we start with the the formula for magnesium fluoride magnesium is a plus two fluoride is a minus one so that's mgf2 solid and that's going to dissociate into magnesium 2+ ion and two fluoride ions F negative don't forget to balance these if you leave off the two it's not correct is it that's going to throw off your your equilibrium calculation now Part B equilibrium constant expression we're going to leave out that solid just like we always do for solids and so KSP equals the magnesium ion concentration times the fluoride concentration squared so that's your KSP let's do part C and calculate the molar solubility of magnesium fluoride once again we don't know what that is so let's call it X and the magnesium ion concentration is also going to be X because it's a one: one ratio the fluoride ion concentration is going to be 2x isn't it because it's a 1:2 ratio by looking at the balanced equation well now we can take these variables and plug those into the KSP expression the KSP is 5.16 * 10 to the 11th right out of the problem magnesium is X fluoride is 2X and that has to be squared so 2x^ 2ar * X is 4X cubed so we can divide both sides by four and we get that X cubed = 1.29 * 10 11th and then we can take the cube root and find that X = 2.35 * 10 -4 and back in our equation we see that X is equal to the molar solubility of this compound isn't it so our molar solubility of magnesium fluoride is about 2.35 * 10 the -4 moles per liter so that's the answer to part C the part D let's calculate this in grams per liter so all we have to do is take that 2.35 * 10us 4 moles per liter of magnesium fluoride and let's convert this to grams per liter this is just a simple mol to gram conversion so in our conversion factor one mole goes on the bottom so it'll cancel and grams on top and by looking at the periodic table uh magnesium and then two fluorides add up to about 62.3 30 G in a mole so when you cancel moles you can multiply across and you'll find that the solubility in grams per liter is 0146 G per liter so once again a fairly small number but not nearly as small as we had in the last example and that makes sense looking at the size of that KSP I hope you've enjoyed this video and have learned something from it hope you've learned how to calculate KS p and Molar solubility and solubilities in this video if you have consider giving

this video we're moving on with the next video in AP Chemistry unit 7 section 11 and this is about how we can work with Solutions and equilibrium now in this video we're actually going to see if we can predict whether or not a precipitate is going to form based upon the addition of two solutions now there's a lot going on here so you'll need to pay close attention keep your calculator handy here and uh follow along with these calculations so in this question it says a chemist adds 100.0 millit of25 molar sodium chloride to 200.0 milliliters of200 molar lead to nitrate if the KSP for lead 2 chloride is 1.7 * 10-5 will a precipitate of lead 2 chloride form now there's a strategy that we need to have here as we work this problem the first thing that you need to realize is this is a q versus K problem now a couple of videos ago we we learned Q versus K whenever you have a a mixture that might not be at equilibrium and you're not sure is it going to go uh to the right or to the left uh that's kind of what you have here this is a q versus K problem our strategy basically is in three parts the first part is to find the concentrations of each component of the possible precipitate after the solutions are combined this is going to be a fairly simple solution chemistry St geometry problem the second step in the strategy is to plug those concentrations into the expression for Q in case you've forgotten the expression for Q looks exactly the same as the expression for K products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficient then the third step is to compare the value of Q with the value of K if Q is greater than K we are going to have a precipitate if Q is less than K there is no precipitate so let's try a couple problems here here's the first example now this is the the same problem that we had before I already read that so we're going to find the concentrations of each component of the possible precipitate now the possible precipitate is lead to chloride and we know that because it gives us the KSP for lead to Chloride we also know that because the other combination sodium nitrate well that's soluble that's not going to make any any precipitate to speak of so we're going to work with lead to Chloride so let's start by finding out the concentration of lead now concentration is moles divided by liters so let's find the moles of lead ions well it says2 molar time2 lers here so if you multiply those by each other we find that we have 0.04 moles of lead in the mixture now to find the marity we have to divide this by the volume now the total volume when you mix 100 milliliters to 200 Millers right here will be 300 millit so that's why we're dividing by the point 3 l that's the total volume after you've mixed the two solutions together we're assuming that volumes are additive so when you divide that out you find that the marity of the lead ions will be33 moles per liter so that's our lead now let's see about the chloride so let's find moles of chloride we're going to take .250 molar time .1 L and that's going to give us 025 moles of chloride when you divide that by your total volume3 L you find that that the marity of chloride will be 0833 molar so that's our first step here we've determined the concentrations of lead and chloride in our resulting solution after they've been mixed now let's plug these into the expression for Q so first of all we're going to need an equation so here's the equation here's the lead to Chloride because that's the potential precipitate that we're going to make and so it would dissociate into lead 2+ ions and two of these chloride ions so once again we write the expression for Q looks just like the expression for K of course we can't call it K because we're not necessarily at equilibrium so now we're going to plug in the numbers that we calculated in the last step and just plug those right in there .1 33 * 0833 sared and so when you do that you find that Q equals 9.2 * 10 -4 so there's our Q now just like in any Q versus K problem like we had a couple of videos ago we have to compare them so is Q greater than K or is Q less than K well looks like Q is greater than K so since that's the case a precipitate will form now sometimes like I mentioned in the last video sometimes there will be students who uh kind of confuse uh q and K and which direction it goes well notice that in this particular example here we have q greater than K so if you forget about how that works draw the Pac-Man like I showed you in that other video and you notice that that Pac-Man looks like it's going to the left so since it's going to the left well what's on the left side of this equation well right there the left side has the solid so we are going to be making that precipitate let's try another example a chemist adds 200.0 milliliters of 1.00 * 10 -3rd molar lithium nitrate to 100.0 ml of .10 molar sodium phosphate if the KSP for lithium phosphate is 2.4 * 10 the 11th will a precipitate of lithium phosphate form so it's the same kind of problem the same strategy the first thing we're going to do is find the concentrations of each component in that lithium phosphate after the two solutions are combined so let's do the lithium first so looks like the marity is 1 * 10 -3rd molar we times that by. 2 L and we find that the moles of lithium will be 2.00 * 10 -4 and to find marity we have to divide this by the total volume we're adding 200 milliliters to 150 milliliters of the other one so that's 350 ml total so we divide by 350 l the lithium ion concentration is 5.71 * 10 -4 we're going to need to do uh to do the same thing for the phosphat so we'll take a look at that it looks like we have 010 molar phosphate times .150 l so when you multiply that together you get 0.015 moles of phosphate and we're going to divide that by the same total volume 350 L and we find that the marity of phosphate in our combined solution will be 0429 molar phosphate so that's the first step in our strategy we've we've calculated the concentrations of the lithium and the phosphate so now we're going to do the second step and plug those numbers into the expression for Q so we need to write the expression for Q first and that comes from the balanced equation so lithium phosphate li3 po4 solid and we're going to be producing three lithium ions because there's a little three right there and one phosphate ion so our Q expression looks like this it's equal to lithium ions cubed times phosphate ions so we're going to plug in those numbers that we calculated in the last step right in here and when we key that into our calculator 5.71 * 10 -4 raised to the 3r power time 0429 we find that the value for Q is 8.0 * 10 to the -12th and we can take a look at the comparison once again in our next step Q versus K and so there's q and there's K so is Q greater than K or less than K well it's less than K isn't it so since that's the case we are not going to form a precipitate think about Q being less than K and if you forget which direction that means well draw in the Pac-Man here and looks like Pac-Man is going to the right so when Pac-Man is going to the right but what's written on the right side of the equation well here's the equation on the right side it's the ion form there's no solid there so that means no solid you're going to have just ions no precipitate forms now let's take a look at another application of precipitates and solution chemistry and equilibrium here we have a different type of question it says if 020 molar of sodium chloride solution is added dropwise to a beaker containing 30 m lead to nitrate and3 mol Mercury to nitrate Solutions which precipitate will form first so this is an interesting question we have two potential possibilities we know that uh if we just dump the whole in uh this whole thing in we'll have lead chloride and Mercury 2 chloride but the question is adding it dropwise which one forms first and we have the two potential precipitates and the the two Ksp values well the one that forms first is going to be the one that's least soluble isn't it and the one that's least soluble is the lead to chloride and so our rationale is that lead to Chloride will form first because its KSP value is smaller therefore lead 2 chloride is less soluble than mercury2 chloride I hope this video has helped you to to apply the Q

"Common-Ion Effect & Final Equilibrium Topics - AP Chem Unit 7, Topics 12-14","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to work with other important concepts of equilibrium, such as the common-ion effect, pH and solubility, and free energy of dissolution. 00:00  Common-Ion Effect 04:00  pH and Solubility 06:06  Free Energy of Dissolution 08:18  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiGlY18M3FQ&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=77,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this video we're going to take a look at the last three sections of unit 7 sections 12 13 and 14 and in this first section here section 12 this is about the common ion effect now to illustrate this let's imagine that we have a saturated solution of calcium sulfate cao4 now like we said in our earlier videos if you have a saturated solution that means it's at equilibrium so we have a nice equilibrium going on here between the the two sides of this process well what do you think is going to happen if all of a sudden we toss in some solid sodium sulfate to this container or this Beaker well we know that some of it is is going to have to ionize and we're going to have some sulfate ions swimming around in solution aren't we well this sulfate ion being added into something at equilibrium is exactly what happens in later's principle like we talked about in an earlier video in this unit uh we are adding in the sulfate which is a product so guess what it's going to shift the equilibrium in the other direction which means we're going to shift it to the left and we're going to create some calcium sulfate precipitate so this would have worked if you had added in some calcium ions as well well maybe some I don't know calcium chloride or something if you anytime you're adding a product ion here it's going to shift it to the left when you're at equilibrium and you're going to make the solid that's the common ion effect now here we have a couple questions a chemistry student has a saturated solution of silver iodide in a beaker which of the following solids when added to the solution would result in a solid precipitate of silver iodide being formed well we have to remember just like in that last example if there's a saturated solution of silver iodide it's an equilibrium isn't it saturated means equilibrium so you could add silver ions you could add iodide ions either one of those would shift that equilibrium to the left and force the reaction to make some precipitate of Sil of silver iodide well which of these four things or four choices has either silver or iodide in it well there's only one choice isn't there it's Choice D the pottassium iodide those other three would not really work here's another question calcium fluoride is very soluble in pure distilled water but it is less soluble in fluoridated tap water and almost completely insoluble in Benzene explain these observations well we know know that uh fluorides most fluorides are fairly soluble in distilled water not all of them but most of them are but why is it less soluble in fluoridated tap water well fluoridated tap water has fluoride in it already yeah doesn't it and so the presence of those fluoride ions in that water is going to limit its ability to dissolve as much calcium fluoride due to that common ion effect it's almost like this this water has a a capacity to dissolve a certain number of fluoride ions and the fluoride from the fluoridation is taking up some of that capacity how about the Benzene well ionic compounds such as calcium fluoride are are very polar and ionic compounds usually don't dissolve in a non-polar solvent like Benzene which is C6 H6 it's just a hydrocarbon so in a non-polar solvent not going to work very well well let's take a look at the next section section 13 which is about the solubility of compounds and how that's sometimes going to be dependent on ph what you need to know about this is that compounds that contain conjugate bases of weak acids are more soluble at a more acidic pH when you think about conjugate bases of weak acids that would include ions like a lot of these here or these are some common examples I should say fluoride carbonate phosphate cyanide the bromate and so if we think about compounds that contain those those ions well we have a few good examples here now a lot of these as you can see are substances that are not that soluble to start with like calcium carbonate that's basically what's found in Limestone limestone is not something that's going to dissolve in water very easily however if you have a more acidic pH all of a sudden a little bit more of that calcium carbonate not a whole lot but some of it will start to dissolve and if you have enough acid and enough time it's going to dissolve isn't it this explains why if you have a statue that's made of limestone calcium carbonate and it comes in contact with acid rain has a more acidic pH that acid rain given enough time is going to slowly dissolve that calcium carbonate Limestone statue because of the pH dependency of that solubility now compounds that have conjugate bases of strong acids well those have solubilities that aren't very dependent on ph generally speaking so we know that you know bromide and chloride and iodide and perchlorate you know those are conjugate bases of strong acids and so these substances if you get this more acidic it's not really going to change the solubility very much let's take a look at section 14 which is about entropy now we're going to talk much more about entropy in unit 9 but let's just barely mention this here in this section entropy is the amount of disorder or sometimes we say chaos in a system that's how most of us think about entropy now technically probably the more correct statement is the quantity of possible energy states of the components of a system uh for all practical purposes that's pretty much the same thing as saying how much disorder or chaos you have in something for example if you have a solid we've talked about how solids have a nice beautiful crystallin structure there's this very orderly this very arranged crystal lattice not much entropy there not a whole lot of disorder but all of a sudden if you take this solid and dissolve it into water you now have ions that are now swimming around in the water and there's a lot more disorder there there's more entropy there are a whole lot more possible energy states or more possible places where those ions could be more entropy is in that aquous solution we'll talk much more about this in Unit Nine now as you go forward you know once you have a solid that is dissolved into aqueous solution that is an increase in entropy now entropy is increasing we use the letter s to describe entropy just like we use the letter H to talk about enthalpy well s is for entropy now if this process is taking place and the system is releasing heat the surroundings are getting hotter or warmer then we say it's exothermic and the Delta h of that process is going to be a negative value if on the other hand this process takes place and the system is absorbing heat from the surroundings and the surroundings are getting colder well that's called endothermic and Delta H is going to be a positive number so I hope you were able to learn something here about the last three sections of unit 7 hope you've learned about equilibrium in my video series here and I hope to see you in my next video where we're going to move right into Unit 8 which is about acids and bases

"Acids, Bases, and the pH Concept - AP Chem Unit 8, Topic 1a","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses the difference between strong and weak acids, as well as the difference between strong and weak bases.  He introduces students to the autoionization of water and the relationship between hydronium ion concentration and hydroxide ion concentration.  He finishes the video by showing how to calculate pH, and how to calculate hydronium ion concentration given the pH.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUpYdKS7C6s&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=78,as we start our discussion of acids and bases we're going to begin by looking at the strength of acids now this is something that we've talked about a little bit already but we know that the that the strength of an acid specifically refers to the percentage dissociation of that acid now already in this course we've talked about how there are only six strong acids out there and a strong acid is one that is 100% dissociated that means that all of its molecules are going to break apart into their component ions when it's in aquous solution these are the six strong acids that you've already learned about in unit four of AP Chemistry so that would be Hydrochloric hydr bromic Hydro iodic sulfuric Nitric and perchloric acids those are the six strong acids that you need to know about in AP Chemistry now there are hundreds if not thousands or more other acids and most of those acids are well under 100% dissociated in fact most of them are actually under 5% dissociated and those are the weak acids now those are acids that you have all these acid molecules only a fraction of them dissociate into their component ions in Weak acids most in fact at least some of those uh weak acid molecules are just going to stay stuck together that's what makes them weak acids now the thing is with the bases it kind of works the same way the strength of a base specifically refers to the percentage dissociation of the base and a strong base uh just like a strong acid is 100% dissociated And just like we learned back earlier in this course there are only eight strong bases that you need to know about in AP Chemistry and those are essentially the group one and two hydroxides so that would be lithium hydroxide sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide rubidium hydroxide cium hydroxide and then your your your heavier three hydroxides your calcium hydroxide berium hydroxide and strontium hydroxide those lighter ones like uh brillium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide those aren't honestly that soluble in water so they're not going to dissociate anyway so those are your eight strong bases now most other bases are once again well under 100% dissociated like I said same way with the acids most of them are actually under 5% and those are called the weak bases so that means in a weak base you're going to have only some of those those base molecules that dissociate in solution most if not or at least some of those base molecules will stay stuck together in aquous solution now when we talk about acids and bases it's important that we understand a very special reaction this is something called the auto ionization of water and this is a reaction that takes place uh in water in pure water and it takes place pretty much all the time in fact it takes place pretty much anywhere that there is water present and this is the reaction it's basically two water molecules colliding with each other and one of those water molecules gains a proton and becomes hydronium h3o+ and then the other water molecule loses the proton and becomes hydroxide both of those ions of course are aquous now like I said this reaction does take place but not to a very great extent in fact it takes place to such a small extent that its equilibrium constants at 25° is about 1 * 10 -14th power now that's a very small equilibrium constant but as it turns out it is a very important equilibrium constant in chemistry in acidbase chemistry it's so important that we actually give it its own letter in our equilibrium alphabet when I say equilibrium alphabet you might remember that we've talked about KC we've talked about KP we've talked about KSP well this equilibrium constant is called KW and of course the W stands for water and we can write it as h3o+ time ohus concentrations when multiplied by each other equal 1.00 * 104th and notice this is written just like any other equilibrium constant expression products over reactants raised the power of the coefficients uh but notice water is a liquid so it is omitted so that's why nothing is in the denominator of this so that's the equation that we're going to use for k w now what that means is that if we know the hydronium ion concentration in any solution at 25° C we can calculate the hydroxide concentration and the opposite is true as well if we know the hydroxide concentration we can calculate the hydronium ion concentration now before we go too far into this I want to show you something that you will often see in a lot of textbooks and sometimes other uh chemistry assignments as well sometimes they will write the equation like this H+ time o minus equals KW and just be aware that that is an equivalent alternate way of writing this in AP Chemistry it is preferred that you write it like this h3o+ but if you write it as H+ that's fine as well that is that is okay that's just kind of a shorthand of writing uh that equation now let's take a look at an example here let's imagine that the H+ concentration in a solution at 25° C is equal to 4.5 * 105th moles per liter calculate its hydroxide concentration now all we have to do is plug and chug into that equation and notice I've written it here just like I wrote it up here in red in its abbreviated form so we're we're going to plug in the hydrogen ion or the hydronium ion concentration into the equation and we're trying to solve for hydroxide so on your calculator you would take 1.00 * 10 to the -14th and divide by 4.5 * 105 and when you compute that you should get an answer of hydroxide ion concentration is equal to 2.2 * 10 -10th molar so that's how you solve with this equation or you could try something like this once again same deal a solution at 25° C has a hydroxide ion concentration of 5.3 * 108 moles per liter calculate the H+ ion concentration in this solution same same idea there just plug and chug into that equation this time we're going to plug the hydroxide into its slot there the 5.3 * 10 the8 and so now to solve for the H+ concentration we just take 1.0 * 10 -14 and divide by 5.3 * 10 the8 and your answer should be about 1.9 * 10 -7th moles per liter so if you know the H+ you can calculate the O minus and it goes both ways so that's a neat little calculation that you can do using the auto ionization of water now let's talk about pH because P pH as you are probably aware is an important uh measurement to show us how acidic or how non acidic which is a basic something is so the way we calculate that is pH equals the negative log of the hydronium ion concentration and and we usually just write it like this pH equals negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration pH basically stands for the French equivalent of power of the hydrogen in which power literally is talking about the power the exponent so that means that if you have an H+ concentration of 1 * 10us one then the pH is just one you can plug this into your calculator or you can look at that little exponent there and take the a negative of that and see your pH likewise if your H+ ion concentration is 1 * 102 power then your pH is going to be two if your H+ concentration is 1 * 10 the -3rd power the pH is three we can keep on using that same pattern if the H+ ion concentration is 1 * 10 the 11th then the pH is just 11 U if H+ is 1 * 10us 7th power pH is 7 and as you probably know the pH of 7 is considered to be neutral at 25° C now if you have a value like this you're actually going to have to plug it into your calculator you're going to have to take the negative log of 2.3 * 10 the -6 and your scientific calculator has a button for that it is the log button and when you find the pH you'll find that it's about 5.64 sometimes you'll have something like this where it gives you the hydroxide concentration now do you know how to find the H+ concentration from that well we just found that in the previous example right you take 1 * 10 -4th and divide it by this number to get the H+ concentration and then you take the negative log and if you do that you should get about 11.18 so that's how you calculate pH now can you go the other direction well if we rearrange the equation the H+ concentration is equal to 10 to the pH power so if we have a solution where the pH is 1.0 that means that the h plus concentration is 10 to the -1 power which is of course just .1 moles per liter where if the pH is three then the H+ ion concentration is 10^ the -3 power which is .001 moles per liter or if the pH is 9.58 then the H+ concentration is going to be 10 to the 9.58 power now you're probably going to need a calculator to solve what that is in fact your calculator has a button just for this this is the anti-log button if you look on your log button on your calculator it probably has a 10 to the x button on there 10 to the X symbol you can find 10 the 9.58 pretty easily and find that it's 2.63 * 10 -10th moles per liter if you have a pH of negative. 54 and by the way that is possible you can have a Negative PH then all you have to do to find H+ is take 10 to the well the negative negative .54 so it's it's really 10 to the positive .54 isn't it so key that into your calculator and you'll find that the H+ concentration is 3.47 moles per liter so hopefully you've learned something about pH the auto ionization of water and how to calculate pH and H+ and hydroxide ion concentration if you've learned something from this video please hit that Thumbs Up Button I'm Jeremy Krug in the next video join me for a discussion about

are moving on with some more of Unit 8 section one and we're looking at the pH scale as you can see here we have a Graphic of essentially what this looks like so essentially at the lower end of this pH scale pH is lower than about seven we have items that we would normally consider to be acidic things like uh soft drinks or lemon juice even coffee and of course laboratory acids would be on the acidic side of that now as you can see seven is it's about neutral that's water a distilled water greater than seven will be the bases and so things like cleaning solutions or hand soap even things like baking soda those will be on the basic side or the higher side of the pH scale I have this just generally going from 0 to 14 but it can go outside those boundaries as well now in the last video we talked about the p8 scale but we haven't mentioned anything about the P function yet now P Works kind of like pH p is the negative log of hydroxide ions and once again this would be the power of the hydroxide ions and so what that means is that if you have a hydroxide ion concentration of 1 * 104 well the power of the hydroxide is four negative log of that number is the four and so you can key that into your calculator or in this case you can just look at the number and see what the PO is if the hydroxide ion concentration were 1 * 10 -2 the PO of course is going to be two isn't it if it's 1 * 10 the -13th the P is going to be 13 you see how that works if the hydroxide is 1 * 101 it's it's one you can see how that just keeps on going from there if you have something like this you know 1 time 10 to the -6 then the p is going to be six uh sometimes of course you will have to key this into the calculator and you have your log button on your scientific calculator to do this for you uh just take the negative log of 8.4 * 10 the -3rd and you'll find that the p is 2.08 so fairly simple to do that calculation you should be able to key that into your calculator fairly quickly in the matter of just a few seconds to get the answer sometimes you'll have a two-step process where you'll have H+ = 7.5 * 105 and you'll have to determine the hydroxide ion concentration first using the auto ionization of water that we learned in the last video where we said that H+ time o minus equals 1 . * 10 -14 or KW at 25° C when you key this or or plug this into that equation you find that the hydroxide ion concentration in this example anyway is equal to about 1.33 time 1010th moles per liter now you can just take the negative log of that number and you'll find that the PO is 9.88 so be able to work with the PO concept as well now there is a p concept there is a PO scale but notice everything is flipped around it is basically the reverse it is the Bizarro world of what the pH scale was notice that in this world in the po8 scale the soft drinks and lemon juices actually have a high number 11 13 12 14 in the case of laboratory acids water is still about neutral about a seven but notice that the bases this time have low numbers like ammonia and bleach and oven cleaner and hand soap those are the ones that are less than seven on the p8 scale now if you want to put the two scales together and compare the two this equation right here is all you need to know about how the two scales compare to each other pH plus P equals 14 and that's it so if you know the pH you can figure out the P or vice versa now this is is not just something that we're arbitrarily inventing because I would hold out that this equation up here at the top the essentially the H+ * o minus yields 1 1 * 10 -1 14th is mathematically the same as that equation right there now in this course I don't derive a whole lot of equations but I would like to derive this now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the log of both sides of that equation right there so if I do that it's going to look like this now on the left side here I have the logarithm of a product and we know that log of a * B is equal to the log of a plus the log of B so I'm going to do that over here and say log of hydronium plus the log of hydroxide equals whatever the log of that number on the right is which is basically a -14 so I've just taken the log of both sides now I'm going to multiply this entire equation by1 so when I do that I have negative log of hydronium plus negative log of hydroxide equals pos4 and we know that negative log of hydronium is just pH isn't it and negative log of hydroxide is just P so this equation down here at the bottom is the same as that equation up there at the top they just look different we've just done a little derivation there to make one a little bit more user friendly than possibly the one at the top although the one at the top is not that hard to work with either now let's take what we've learned in this video and the last video and put it all together let's imagine that a solution has a pH of 9.32 let's calculate its H+ ion concentration it's p and its hydroxide ion concentration well let's do part a first we know that if we have the pH the H+ is just going to be 10 to the Negative PH power so I just have to find 10 to 9.32 and a simple scientific calculator will tell me that that's equal to about 4.79 * 10 to -10th moles per liter now Part B says calculate the P well I know that pH plus P equals 14 so for part b i just plug in the pH there you know take just take the 9.32 and subtract it from 14 to find the p and I find that the PO is 4.68 now once I have this information I can solve for part C very easily as well in fact there are a couple different ways to find the hydroxide ion concentration uh I'm going to basically take this equation here and use 10 to the negative p equals the hydroxide ion concentration and I found that the PO was 4.68 just take 10 to the ne 4.68 power and I find that the hydroxide ion concentration is equal to about 2.09 * 105 moles per liter now alternatively you could have taken the value for KW 1.00 * 10-1 14th and divided it by your H+ concentration that you got in part a and you would get the exact same answer so you have a couple ways to solve this last part now before we wrap things up in Unit 8 section one I just want to point out that when we talk about that number 1.0 time 10 -14th that number just like any equilibrium constant only applies at a specific temperature this case it's at 25° C so that means means that the ph and the PO of pure water will be seven but that's only at 25° when you change the temperature you change the KW value which means that you're also changing the ph and Po in theory so if you were to raise the temperature to 40° C which is rather warm water uh well your KW goes up to 2.9 * 10 -14 so that means is that at that temperature let me put this on the on the screen so you can see this that means that at 40° the concentration of H+ times the concentration of of O minus equals not 1 * 10- 14th but 2.9 * 10 -14th and so in pure water these two values would be be equal and they'd be equal to the square root of that number -14 and if you just compute that on your calculator that's 1.7 * 10 the -7th take the negative log of that and you'd find that at 40° C the pH is actually 6.77 now just be aware that that does not mean that at 40° C the pH of water is somehow acidic that's not what that means that just means that your neutral value is 6.77 at 40° C it just changes your your middle point of the pH scale at that temperature let's say that you lower the temperature well at 10° C which is uh that's fairly cold but that's not exactly what you'd call frigid water really I mean that's still temperate for most climates in certain times of the year Well KW at that temperature is smaller it's gone down to 2.9 * 10 to the -5th power so what that means is that at that temperature the concentration of H+ times the concentration of O minus equals 2.9 * 10- 15 and if you have pure F water it's neutral these two values are equal which means that the H+ I wrote that in a bad place didn't I H+ * o minus equals the Square < t of 2.9 * 105th so if you find the ph and P of that will you take the negative log of the square root of that number which is 5.4 * 10- 8 and you'd find that the p pH and po at that colder temperature is going to be 7.27 and once again that doesn't mean that at that cold temperature your pure water is going to be a basic somehow it just means that your neutral value is now 7.27 you can actually observe this if you buy a in fact you can obtain a a fairly cheap pH meter off of Amazon for about $15 or so and you can observe this in in some cases hope you learned something about acids and bases and the auto ionization of water and how KW changes when you're not at 25° C if you learn something please

"How to Calculate pH & pOH for Strong Acids & Bases - AP Chem Unit 8, Topic 2","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to calculate the pH of strong acids and bases.  He works several problems, including a problem where two strong acids are combined and we are asked to calculate its hydronium ion concentration and pH. 00:00  Introduction 00:20  Calculating pH of Strong Acids 03:13  Calculating pH and pOH of Strong Bases 06:49  Combining 2 Strong Acids 09:39  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8soANOG1O_0&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=80,AP Chemistry Unit 8 section two is all about strong acids and strong bases if you haven't already subscribed consider hitting that subscribe button and that way you'll have instant access to all 100 plus of my AP Chemistry daily videos as well as AP uh review videos problem walkthroughs all kinds of good stuff well when we talk about strong acids remember these are the acids that are completely dissociated that means all of the acid molecules break apart into their ion form and the ions are swimming around in solution so because of that for a strong acid the H+ concentration is equal to the concentration of the acid so in the case of 05 molar HCL you just have to take the negative log of 005 and you can take your calculator and follow along with me here and you'll find that the pH is just equal to 1.30 or in the case of 003 molar nitric acid just take negative log of .003 to find the ph and that's going to be about 2.52 if we have 1.0 * 10-5 molar Hydro iic acid that's a strong acid too just take the pH of that number and you might remember from an earlier video a couple videos back in our last section you just can eyeball that and see that the pH is five isn't it you you honestly don't even need your calculator for that one the next example take the negative log of 12 and plug that into your calculator your answer is negative 1.08 some people wonder is it possible to have a Negative PH it is if you have a strong acid and it is a concentrated strong acid then yes yes you can have a Negative PH just like you can have a PO that's negative or a pH that's greater than 14 as well in some cases um how about this last one pH of 1 * 10 -14th molar HCL that is really dilute isn't it well you take the pH of that number and you get an answer that doesn't make a whole lot of sense you get 14 and we have something that's an acid it's just a very very diluted acid so how can it have a basic pH if it's an acid well the answer is it can't that's why I put a strike through through that number because the answer doesn't make any sense does it when you have something that is that dilute it is so diluted that is it is practically water and it has been diluted with water well if that's the case then the pH is going to be seven because most of the high hydrogen in this very very dilute acid is not coming from the acid it's actually coming from the auto ionization of water which means that it essentially has the same uh pH as as water does so it's going to be seven in this case let's try a couple other uh examples this time with a base let's say that we have a 5.00 gram sample of calcium hydroxide that is dissolved into enough water to make 200 milliliters of solution part A says calculate the concentration of calcium hydroxide well this is just a stochiometry problem we have to take the five grams of calcium hydroxide and convert that to moles first of all so let's let's do that we have to put grams on the bottom and one mole on top and we have to consult the periodic table to find the molar mass of that it's one calcium atom two Hydro uh two hydrogens and two oxygens that adds up to about s 74.0 G in a mole of that we can cancel gr and when you divide this 5 / 74.0 n gets you 0645 moles of calcium hydroxide now to find the concentration that's moles per liter so we divide this by the volume which is2 L and when you key this into your calculator you'll find that the marity of calcium hydroxide is equal to 337 molar calcium hydroxide now Part B is a slightly different question isn't it this one says calculate the concentration of just the hydroxide ions well we can look at this and realize that when this dissociates every one calcium hydroxide is going to give you two hydroxides this little two right here tells us that so that's why in our mole ratio if you even want to write one you might just be able to see this in your head but if you put one calcium hydroxide on top that's equal to two hydroxide ions so we just multiply this value by two and you find that the marity of hydroxide ions will be twice what your original answer was so it's 674 molar hydroxide ions now that's part B part C says calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution or hydronium ions well what we do here is use this equation the auto ionization of water H+ * o minus = 1.00 * 10 -14 and I plug in that 674 that I got in the last part of the question so now to find the H+ concentration I just take 1 * 10-14 and divide it by 674 and the answer I get is about 1.48 * 10 -14th very very small number but that makes sense because this is a base and it this is a strong base so we're not going to have a whole lot of of hydronium ions swimming around there now Part D says calculate the pH of the solution if I know the H+ I can calcul calculate the pH by just taking the negative log of that number so negative log of 1.48 * 10 -14 is equal to 13.83 and so that's how I solve a problem multistep problem here with p and pH and a strong base let's take a different kind of strong acid problem this time this one involves the combination or the addition of two strong acids it says a student combines 100 Mill of50 molar HCL with 200 millit of 3000 mol hno3 assuming that volumes are additive calculate the pH of the resulting solution so what we have to remember here is that there are two sources of hydronium ions that are going to be contributing to the pH there's the HCL and then there's the H3 let's figure out how many moles of hydronium or H+ we're getting from the HCL this hydrochloric acid so the way I do that is I take once again the volume times the marity .1 L time .5 moles per liter and of course .1 * 05 is 05 isn't it so 05 moles of hydrogen ions from from uh from that Source the HCL let's do the hno3 it's done essentially the same way we take the 2 * 32 L * 3 molar and when you multiply those you get 06 moles of H+ from the hno3 so now we're going to add those because if you have 05 moles from one source and 006 moles from other source the total moles will be11 so we have1 moles of H+ total now we want to find the marity of the H+ total so I have to divide by the total volume now What's the total volume here we had 100 Ms added to 200 Ms of solution we're assuming that volumes are additive so that means that your total volume is going to be 300 Ms so we divide this by .3 lers of our total volume so when you divide this out on your calculator .11 moles of H+ divided by 3000 lers you find that the marity of H+ is 367 molar so now if we know the the marity of hydrogen ions we can find the pH pretty easily can't we just take the negative log of that so negative log of 367 is equal to 044 and that's the answer and that makes sense because we have two strong acids here you would expect the pH to be a fairly small number so I hope you've learned something from this video about uh strong acids and adding strong acids together working problems with strong bases doing the sto geometry on that and finding the ph and P of those as well if you learned something please

"Let's Solve Weak Acid Problems! - AP Chemistry Unit 8, Topic 3a","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to recognize a weak acid and how to solve weak acid problems.  He shows students how to use Ka values (acid dissociation constants) to rank the relative strength of acids.  Then he continues with several example problems on calculating pH of weak acids and calculating Ka. 00:00  Introduction 00:19  Recognizing Weak Acids 02:45  Ka and Relative Strength of Weak Acids 05:45  Calculating pH of a Weak Acid 11:28  Determining Ka of a Weak Acid 13:56  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjbAPEFSZvo&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=81,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and this is the first in a series of three videos that's going to cover AP Chemistry Unit 8 section three which is about weak acids and weak bases this is a big one so make sure that you're taking notes and you're following along and you are uh using your calculator to follow along as we go here now as we said in section one of this unit most acids are weak now just as a review when we say weak that's the opposite of well strong so if you want to take a look at a strong acid and there are only six that we think about in AP Chemistry here's one of them nitric acid and when it dissociates that means that 100% of these nitric acid molecules will dissociate and break apart into its component ions hydrogen ion and the nitrate ion well in the case of weak acids they dissociate much less than that 100% so here's a very good example of a weak acid we have acetic acid sometimes known as vinegar it's formula is H C2 h32 and when it's reacted with water we have notice that we have an equilibrium here and as we learned in unit 7 that means that there's going to be a forward process there's always going to be a reverse process as well so we're going to be making some hydronium ions and some acetate ions but then some of these are going to go backwards and create the reactants again and so once you get to equilibrium often less than about 5% of your acid molecules are actually going to dissociate so instead of having a 100% dissociation it's more like maybe a 3% or a 1% or a 0.5% a very small fraction much less than 100% of those molecules are going to break apart into their component ions now if you're ever asked to write the reaction for this like we did back in unit 4 remember that when an acid reacts with water the two products are going to be hydronium and the conjugate base of the acid that you started with and if you forgot the way you write the conjugate base is just to take off an H+ from the acid so this is the conjugate base because it's just had an H+ taken off from the acid back there at the beginning now when we do calculations with this we have to remember that since there is an equilibrium going on there's a forward reaction there's a reverse reaction we have to work this like an equilibrium problem so if you have this uh equation or this reaction taking place and there is a reversible process going on here what that means is that it has an equilibrium constant and so the equilibrium constant for this process is 1.8 * 10 -5 now as you've learned already in this course we've had um quite a rather extensive alphabet of equilibrium constants we had KC we had KP we had KSP here a couple of videos ago we had KW back in Unit 8 section 1 well now we have Ka I bet you can guess what the a stands for a stands for acid and so this is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an acid Ka sometimes called the acid dissociation constant now let's say we have another weak acid um hydrocyanic acid it reacts with water we have hydronium and the conjugate base its Ka is of course a different number it's 4.9 * 10-10 I want you to notice that there is a very large difference between those two Ka values now generally speaking the larger the KA value is the stronger the acid is going to be so it's safe to say that AIC acid up here is much stronger than hydrocyanic acid is going to be because it's Ka you know hcn is a very small Ka and HC or H C2 h302 is much larger by Factory of somewhere around 10 to the 5th power so that's a a pretty safe calculation or or comparison I should say to make there now let's take this concept here and let's rank these three acids in order of strength from strongest to weakest now I hope hope that you can look at those three acids and realize that one is not like the others there is a strong acid in there right nitric acid is one of our six strong acids now you have to know that the College Board is not going to tell you that you have to know that nitric acid is one of the six big acids those big strong acids so that's the strongest now to figure out the other two we need Ka values so I'm going to put those up here on the screen and now now we can figure out those other two right at this point we see lactic acid is much uh Stronger because its Ka value is much larger so lactic acid is the next strongest boric acid is the weakest of those three now we're going to do a few problems in fact this video and the next video we're going to do some practice with calculating the pH of weak acids now remember like I said there's an equili ibum going on here so we have to work this as an equilibrium problem so the problem says that the KA for acetic acid is 1.8 * 10-5 part A says write the equilibrium constant expression for this acid well before we do that we have to have a balanced equation so we will write the acid dissociation equation for acetic acid we react it with water and we have hydronium of course and the conjugate base now you should be able to write that equation but here it is for you now part A says write that equilibrium constant expression well it's written like it always is products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficients all the coefficients are one so Ka equals hydronium ion concentration times the acetate ion concentration all over the acetic acid concentration don't forget to leave out water because it's a liquid and liquids aren't in that expression now Part B says calculate the H+ ion concentration in a 75 mol solution of acetic acid now this is where we're going to work this as an equilibrium problem now you might remember in unit 7 we used the ice box method in order to solve these so we're going to put ice along the side that stands for initial change and equilibrium and the problem says that the initial concentration of a c acid is 75 molar so I'm going to put that right here now we don't care about water because it's a liquid so we're just going to ignore that the these others hydronium and acetate start out at zero in these problems the the initial concentration of your products will be zero and as it turns out that's all that the problem tells us other than the equilibrium constant so that means we don't know what the change is going to be so that means this side has to go down the product side or the reactant side goes down and we don't know by how much so let's call it minus X the product side has to go up by the same amount because the mole ratio is a one: one so it's plus X and this one is also going to be a plus X because its mole ratio is a a one to one as well so our equilibrium values are going to be 75 minus X x and x so now we are ready to plug these values into that equilibrium constant expression that we just wrote in part A so that means we're just going to plug and chug so Ka I think we said was 1.8 * 10-5 = x * X all over 75 - x now you might remember back to units 7 and we talked about the 5% rule whenever we have a small equilibrium constant something like 10us fifth or smaller it's safe to ignore this minus X right here because it's negligible and the effort that we would expand to solve using the quadratic equation it's really more than it's worth to be honest so I'm just going to ignore that minus X so now we can cross multiply of course x * X is x^2 1.8 * 10-5 * 75 gets us about 1.35 * 10-5 and that's of course equal to x^2 so to solve for x I just take the square root and I find that X is equal to 00367 and as we see in the problem here x is our hydronium ion calculation and as we know hydronium and H+ are essentially interchangeable uh in in AP Chemistry so that's the answer to part B now once we know the hydronium ion concentration part C is easy isn't it the pH is just negative log of H+ like we saw in an earlier video in this unit so just take that on your calculator you'll find that the pH is 2.43 and that makes sense this is a weak acid so it should have a fairly low PH now Part D calculate the percent dissociation of this acid solution well this is where we we take the X and divide it by what x was subtracted from which in this case was 75 so I take the X which was 00367 divided by 75 and to make that into a percent of course I have to times that by 100 so I find that my percent dissociation is 49% now that's a good thing because if I had done this problem and gotten an answer of greater than 5 percent then I would have to realize that this ignoring the minus X was not going to be a correct assumption I'd have to go back through here and use the quadratic equation um college board on the AP exam is not going to make you do that so that's that's a good thing so the percent dissociation in a problem like this should be less than 5% so there we have a multi-art problem let's try another example now in this one it says a85 molar solution of hypochlorous acid hclo is obtained in the lab according to a pH meter the pH of this solution is 3.76 calculate the H+ ion concentration of the solution and the KA of this acid so there we have our acid dissociation equation now if we know the pH we can figure out the H+ pretty easily can't we we know know that H+ concentration is just equal to 10 to the pH so to find the H+ I have the pH there just 10 to the 3.76 power so just some quick calculator work there and I find that the H+ concentration is about 1.74 * 10 -4 moles per liter so that's the first part now the KA of this acid well to calculate that I need to write the k expression so I know what to plug in so once again products over reactants and so Ka equals the hydronium ion concentration times the hypochlorite concentration all over the hypochlorous acid concentration so the KA I know what my H+ is it's just just 1.74 * 10us 4 do you see why the hypochlorite ion concentration has to be the same thing it's a 1: one ratio in this equation so they have to be the same value and in the denominator it says that the concentration of hypochloric acid was .85 molar now technically I know it's actually 085 minus X or 085 minus 1.74 * 10us 4th but you can go ahead and plug that in and you'll find that it's it's for all practical purposes the same as as point 8 5 it doesn't change the value much so go ahead and key that into your calculator and you'll find that the KA of this acid is 3.6 * 10 8 so that's a pretty neat little calculation that you can do according to this all you need is a pH meter and to know the the concentration of your acid and you can actually calculate the acid dissociation constant for pretty much any acid as

"Weak Acids - Problem Walkthroughs - AP Chem Unit 8, Topic 3b","In this video, Mr. Krug walks students through three common types of weak acid problems and shows students how to solve them, step by step.  00:00  Introduction 00:33  Problem One: We Are Given Ka 04:43  Problem Two:  We Calculate Ka From % Dissociation 08:01  Problem Three:  Diprotic Acid 14:08  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyBJEVR9V58&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=82,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to be continuing in our second of three videos that are going to cover AP Chemistry Unit 8 section three this is about weak acids and bases in this video we are focusing on practice problems with weak acids if you haven't subscribed yet go ahead and consider subscribing that way you'll have instant access to my 100 plus AP Chemistry daily videos as well as AP review videos problem walkthroughs all kinds of good stuff so let's jump right into our practice session here so this one says hydrofluoric acid is used for glass etching in art its Ka is 6.8 * 104 right the acid dissociation reaction for this acid its Ka expression the H+ and pH of a 60 molar solution of HF and the percent dissociation of this acid so let's do part a this reaction hydrochloric acid of course is HF and we always write these being added to water so the products are going to be hydronium and the conjugate base of the acid which is fluide so that's part A now the KA expression is just products over reactants there are no coefficients in this one uh we're going to leave out water because it's a liquid so there's our Ka expression just like it would be for any uh equilibrium constant expression now part C this is kind of where the bread and butter of this uh problem comes in here the H+ and pH of a 60 molar solution of HF so we're going to use an ice box for this that stands for initial change and equilibrium and for the initial concentration of HF well the problem tells us it's 60 moles per liter we're not going to worry about water since it's a liquid the other products are going to be zero hydronium and fluoride are zero that's all that the problem gives us except for the KA value so that means the change is going to be a minus X and hydronium fluoride will have to be plus X for those two because this is a one: one to one ratio so everything is going to go up or down by the same amount so the equilibrium values will be 60- X x and x so now we are ready to plug and chug into the equilibrium constant expression let's see the problem tells us that the KA is 6.8 * 104 so I'll plug that in that's equal to x * X over 60 - x so we see that this is a a fairly small equilibrium constant uh some folks might say this is a little bit on the bubble 10 4th 10 the 5th sometimes that's where it starts to get a little bit precarious as to whether we're going to be able to use the 5% rule but let's go ahead and do that we're going to ignore that minus X to make our math easier so now we can cross multiply so of course x * X is x^2 6 * the KA value gets us 4.08 * 10 -4 so to solve for x I just take the square root and I find that X = 0202 and according to the problem the x value is equal to the hydronium concentration so H+ and so that's my first part of question C now the the next part says what's the pH well that's the easy part from this from this part isn't it if we know the H+ the pH is just negative log of the H+ concentration so negative log of 0202 and you can key that into your calculator and get an answer of about 1.69 so now we can do Part D which is percent dissociation so percent dissociation is just the the value of the change divided by the initial concentration times 100 so when I divide those out and Times by 100 that's 0202 divide by6 * 100 I find that the percent dissociation was 3 4% so yes this is a little higher than some of the others that we've done but still it was okay to do that 5% rule so that is a good example of a very typical weak acid problem let's try another one here we have iotic acid has the formula hio3 a chemist obtains a 0.95 molar solution of iotic acid and notices that it is 34.3% dissociated calcul calate the hydrogen ion concentration the ph and the KA for this acid solution so what we're going to have to do first of all is let's write out our equation so we have hio3 and of course it's added to water and the products for any acid dissociation will always be hydronium and the conjugate base of whatever you started with so that would be io3 negative so now we are ready to set up our ice box and we know that the initial concentration of iotic acid is .95 it gives us that right there in the problem we know that the products are going to be zero now normally this is the point where we'd say Min - x and plus X and plus X but notice in this problem we don't have to say x because we know what percent of the acid is dissociated it's 34.3% so that means that 34.3% % of this 0.95 is going to be subtracted we just have to do the simple arithmetic to figure out how much that is so I have to take the 0.95 molar and take 34.3% of that and I find that that's about 33 so that means that in the change row instead of writing minus X I'm going to write minus33 because it's not unknown it's actually given to us or at least we can calculate it now if this is a minus33 that means that these others over here have to be a plus. 33 and so in my equilibrium row I'm going to have a 62 and of course 33 for these other two over here now that actually is going to answer part A for us because notice that the H+ which is synonymous with the hydronium ion concentration is going to be 33 moles per liter so there we have part a solved for us now Part B the pH if you know the H+ the pH is easy isn't it it's just negative log of H+ so all we have to do is take the negative log of 33 and we find that the pH of this solution is about 0.48 so there we have our pH so there's Part B now part C we have to plug these three equilibrium values into the equilibrium constant expression now we haven't written that yet but it's pretty simple Ka equals the hydronium or the hydrogen ion concentration times the iodate ion concentration all over the the iotic acid concentration so just plug those numbers in and we can solve very simply you know 33 * 33 divided 62 and you find that the KA value is 0.18 so there we have that answer so that's a second example let's try one more for example for weak acids and this one is a little bit more peculiar here we're working with vitamin C ascorbic acid is also known as vitamin C and has the formula H2 C6 h66 it's ka1 is 6.8 * 105 and its ka2 is 2.8 * 10 -12th write the two acid dissociation reactions for this acid the h plus concentration the pH of a25 molar solution of ESC corbic acid so I want you to notice that this acid has two hydrogens instead of just one these two acidic hydrogens will essentially pop off in succession so in our ka1 the first acid Association you write the the acid and of course it's added to water and the products are going to be hydronium just like it always is and the conjugate base which is H C6 h66 negative notice that only one of those H's popped off that's the ka1 because that's the first of these two now in succession the next one is going to pop off so we can write that and for our ka2 we can take the this this conjugate base here that we have and it's actually going to become an acid for this next one so it's going to react with water and it's also going to create hydronium and its conjugate base of that which is C6 h6062 negative so this is the first dissociation that is the second dissociation so we have a ka1 for this reaction and a k A2 for this reaction down here now let's go ahead and and solve Part B the H+ so I'll start with this first one here I'll draw an ice box just like we did before and the initial concentration of the acid is25 moles per liter so that goes in right here these other products are going to be zero and this is all that's given to me except for my Ka value so my change row will be Min - x and then plus X on the other side so the equilibrium is going to be 0.25 - x x and x so now I'm going to plug these values into the equilibrium constant expression this ka1 that I have here so ka1 equals hydronium times that ion all over the ascorbic acid of course water's left out since it's a pure liquid here so plug these values and numbers in there the ka1 is given to to me in the problem so 6.8 * 10-5 = x * X over .25 - x that's this is a pretty small equilibrium constant so I'm going to ignore that minus X to make my math a little bit easier and I'm going to cross multiply and so I have x^2 = 1.7 * 10-5 now I can take the square root to solve for x and when I do that I get that X is 4.1 2 * 10 -3rd and that is my H+ as I saw there in the ice box so now to find the pH I just have to take the negative log of that number U just like we always do for pH and so negative log of that number is going to be equal to 2.38 so that is the pH of this ascorbic acid solution now you might be wondering why did we do all this and just ignore the ka2 because the ka2 was given to us as well well you know we could use that to calculate the additional hydronium ion that was produced in that second acid dissociation but in AP Chemistry we're not going to worry about that and there are honestly two reasons that we're uh not going to do that the first one is if you look at the KA values the ka2 is something like 10 to the 7th smaller than ka1 that means that since the ka2 is so small it's going to produce a minuscule amount of hydronium in fact it's so small it's not worth our time calculating it now just in case you uh want to know I went ahead and calculated it because you you actually can do this it's not it's not that hard it's not really required for the AP curriculum here but I did go ahead and do this and I found that the H+ ion concentration from the ka2 was 1.07 * 10 -7th moles per liter so if you want to find out the total H+ in this reaction then you want to add up the H+ from the ka1 which we did calculate that's this number right here and add in the ka2 value that's the 1.07 * 10- 7th and since it's such a small number I'm going to go ahead and add in the uh H+ from the auto dissociation of water which is pretty darn close to that number actually 1.0 * 10us 7th and when I get that I find a total of 4.12 * 10us 3r it really has not changed uh my value any so that's why we're not going to worry about the ka2 calculations in AP chemistry if you want to do that your general chemistry textbook may go ahead and lead you through that and you're welcome to learn that but that's certainly not required so this is the second video If you learned something please smash that thumbs up button and if you go ahead and subscribe if you haven't done so already in the next video we're we're going to move on to week bases so I hope to see you in that video thanks for watching,"4,476",0,82
"Let's Solve Weak Base Problems! - AP Chem Unit 8, Topic 3c","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to recognize formulas for weak bases.  Then, he shows students how to use the base dissociation constant, also known as Kb, to determine the pOH and pH for a weak base, while also calculating percent dissociation.  He discusses the relationship between Ka and Kb, then shows the relationship between the strength of a weak acid and the strength of its conjugate base.  00:00  Introduction 00:14  Recognizing Formulas of Weak Bases 01:13  Problem One - Simple Weak Base Problem 05:41  Problem Two - Using pH to Determine Kb 08:38  Relationship Between Ka and Kb 12:01  Problem Three - Using Ka to Solve for pH of Weak Base 15:48  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F8xA8AUfz4&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=83,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this video we are taking a look at more of AP Chemistry Unit 8 section three which is about weak bases in this video now in our last two videos we talked about weak acids this time we're looking at weak bases now when we say weak bases you may be dealing with uh chemicals substances that look kind of like this one thing that you may notice that several of these weak bases have in common is that they have a nitrogen and hydrogen combination in almost all of them and these weak bases these Bron Lowry weak bases are generally going to have this highly electronegative nitrogen atom that is ready to accept a positive hydrogen ion proton now remember according to the Bron dead and Lowry definition a base is going to accept that H+ ion so this these n H combinations make this a very convenient combination so normally if you see a coal bonded compound that has nitrogen and and hydrogen in it it's probably going to be weak a weak base we're going to start by working a couple of weak base problems you'll find that most of these are done almost exactly like weak acid problems with a little twist at the end so in this problem it says consider a 0 4 molar solution of NH3 its KB is 1.8 * 10-5 write the base dissociation reaction for NH3 so first thing we have to do is write that equation so there's the formula for ammonia and it's of course added to water and in a base dissociation the products will be the conjugate acid of that base and hydroxide so the conjugate acid of this ammonia is just addon an H+ so add-on an H+ to NH3 it becomes nh4 positive the ammonium ion and of course there's our hydroxide so that's part A now let's calculate the hydroxide concentration as it tells us to do in Part B we're going to use an ice box method just like we did for weak acids it says the solution of the ammonia is4 moles per liter so I'm going to put that in my initial row of course water is a liquid so I don't care about that uh in the next uh two lines here I'm going to put Zer and zero my initial concentration of products are zero in my change row I see that I'm not given anything else except the KB value so these are going to be Min - x and plus X just like we did for the acids now the equilibrium row is going to be 4- x x and x and so now I'm ready to plug these values into the uh the the KB expression I haven't written that yet but it just looks like this KB equals the ammonium ion concentration times hydroxide all over ammonia just just written like pretty much every other um equilibrium constant expression now we can plug this in here and we notice that this KB value is very small and so I can ignore the minus X using the 5% rule just like we learned to do back in unit 7 so that goes out and when I cross multiply I get x^2 = 7.2 * 10 -6 so now to solve for x I just need to square root both sides and I have x equal 2.68 * 10 -3rd and I can notice by looking at the ice box that the x value is equal to the hydroxide concentration so that's what I was solving for in Part B now for part C well the C is essentially going to be X or the the percent dissociation rather is going to be the x divided by whatever it was subtracted from so that's going to be 2.68 * 10 to the -3rd divided by4 of course times 100 to convert that to a percent so when I divide it I get 67% that's a good thing because if it had been over 5% we would have had to go back all the way through there and use the quadratic equation which we uh probably don't want to do so 67% that's good it's got to be less than 5% so now let's solve for the PO and if we know the hydroxide concentration PO is pretty easy it's just P equals negative log of the hydroxide concentration so just take negative log of 2.68 * 10 -3rd in your calculator and you'll find that the p o is 2.57 so that's part D now part e is the ph and this is the little twist because normally when we solve for x it gets us to pH but this is a base problem so it is it is going to give us the P so to find the pH we have to subtract from 14 using that equation right there so when you subtract from 14 you find that your pH is 11.43 hopefully that makes sense because in a weak base you would expect your pH to be rather significantly above seven uh probably not like 14 or something like that but significantly above seven let's try another problem in this one a student places a pH meter into a 0.35 molar solution of hydrazine in H4 and finds that its pH is 10.89 calculate the hydroxide concentration of the solution and the KB of this weak acid so we're going to start first of all by uh realizing that if we have the pH we really need to have the p in order to find the hydroxide so let's just subtract this from 14 and get this into P so it's 3.11 so now if we know the PO hydroxide is just 10 to the negative P power so that's just a simple calculation on your scientific calculator 10 the 3.11 power and so your hydroxide concentration is equal to 7.76 * 10 -4 moles per liter so that's the answer to part A now for Part B we need to find the KB well in order to calculate KB we have to have a KB expression and in in order to have a KB expression we have to have an equation which we haven't written yet so let's do that the hydrazine is n2h4 and of course it's added to water the products are going to be the conjugate acid which is N2 h5+ and hydroxide so always your products will be the conjugate acid and hydroxide so if that's the case our KB expression is just N2 h5+ time o minus all over into H4 equals KB and so now we can plug some numbers into that equation to solve for KB now we have our hydroxide concentration because we just solved for that so we can plug that in and we have to remember that the N2 h5+ concentration is the same because it's a one: one mole ratio in the equation and in the denominator the n2h4 concentration is. 35 now it's actually. 35 minus the hydroxide concentration but this really doesn't affect our math much so I'm just going to leave it as it is and our KB value is 1.7 * 10 -6 so that's how we can solve for a KB so as you can see we're adding a KB into our alphabet of equilibrium constants we had KC KP KSP KW Ka and now we have KB so we have a a veritable smorgas Board of equilibrium constants here that we've learned in this in the last couple units here now let's take a look at the relationship between Ka and KB as it turns out K time KB equals KW at any specific temperature now since most of our problems that we're going to solve in this course are at 25° C C we know that KW equal 1 * 10- 14 at that temperature so if you know Ka you can solve for KB just by dividing into one * 10us 14th Ka is of course the KA for a weak acid and KB is going to be the KB for its conjugate the base so if you know the KA you can figure out the KB and vice versa if you know the KB you can solve for the KA so we're going to do a few problems at least one problem with this but let's just do a couple of of uh comparisons here let's let's take a look at some weak acids and their Ka values let's calculate the KB for these weak bases so here's propionic acid and it's Ka so can we figure out the KB of its conjugate base and yes we can we just have to realize that it's 1 * 10 -1 14th divided by that Ka value so when you key that into your calculator you find that the KB will be about 7.7 * 10us 10th how about for hydrocyanic acid its Ka is 4.9 * 10 Theus 10th can we find the KB of the cyanide ion well we sure can all we have to do is realize that we just have to take 1 * 10- 14th divided by 4.9 * 10 -10th and when you punch that into your calculator your KB value is 2.0 * 10us 5 now one thing that you'll notice about the KB values is they have very different magnitudes don't they this is a very small number and then this one here is a very well it's a not a small number this is a much larger number than the one up here so when you have a larger value for KB that's a relatively stronger base and the smaller value for KB indicates a weaker base so we can see here that the uh that this ion is a much weaker base than the cyanide ion is and that's interesting because if you compare the acids from which the bases were derived from you might notice it's the reverse isn't it that the propionic acid is the stronger acid because it has the larger Ka value so we kind of see a little relationship here the stronger the acid the weaker its conjugate base is going to be and likewise the weaker an acid is the stronger its conjugate base is going to be we're going to be doing some comparisons of this in a future video but I just wanted to introduce you to this this in this in this section right here let's solve one more problem this one here says calculate the pH of a 1.00 molar solution of sodium fluoride it tells us that the KA for HF at 25° C is 6.8 * 10 -4th power so maybe you're wondering you know it tells us HF and what's this fluoride we got a sodium in there what's what's going on well there are couple of things we have to realize the first thing we have to realize is that sodium ions in fact pretty much all um alkaline metal ions are spectator ions and we can ignore them so what we really have here is a 1.00 molar solution of fluoride ions that's what we have here and our next step once we realize that is to calculate the KB for this flu ride ion so we know what the KA is so to find the KB we just take 1 * 10-4 and divide by the KA that we had so that means that the KB will be 1.5 * 101th so there we have our next step so now once we have that let's write the dissociation of the weak base F negative and work the problem just like we always have so now we can do that so let's write the equation fluoride and of course it's added to water the products are going to be the conjugate acid of this base along with hydroxide so we have HF and hydroxide so now we're ready to set up our ice box so we have this our initial concentration of fluoride will be one molar the products are going to be essentially zero and so now in our change row we notice that we're not given any anything else any more information other than the dissociation constants here so it's Min - x and then plus X on the product side so our equilibrium values will be 1 - x and then x and x so now we are ready to plug these numbers into the equilibrium constant expression so for this it's going to be KB equals HF times hydroxide all over the fluoride concentrations so when I plug these in I got my KB that I calculated a minute ago so 1.5 * 10 11 = x^2 all over 1 - x this is a very small equilibrium constant so I feel pretty confident in taking taking out that minus X there and when I cross multiply my math is pretty easy here I have x^2 equals 1.5 * 10 11th so to solve for x I just have to take this square root so I find that x = 3.9 * 10 -6 and so that is my hydroxide ion concentration so if I know that I can solve for the P pretty easily just by taking the negative log of that and so just the negative log of 3.9 * 10 -6 is about 5.41 and so once I know P I just have to subtract that from 14 to solve for the pH so that will be 8.59 so that's the pH of this weak base and as we can see it's not that basic so the pH is is it is over seven but not significantly not like a 14 or a 13 or something like that 8.59 is moderately basic I hope you've learned something about weak bases and acids and bases in this series of three videos

look at AP Chemistry Unit 8 section 4 which is all about the reaction of acids with bases if you haven't subscribed to my channel yet go ahead and consider clicking that subscribe button that way you'll have instant access to all of my 100 plus AP Chemistry daily videos as well as AP review videos problem walkthroughs all kinds of good stuff let's go ahead and jump into what happens when a strong acid reacts with the strong base now this is a very common uh type of question that's asked on AP Chemistry or in general chemistry courses and this might be a very typical example of that Solutions of hydrochloric acid and potassium hydroxide are mixed together well anytime you have a strong acid reacting with a strong base the net ionic reaction is always the same and this is something that we mentioned way back in unit 4 but this is certainly worth repeating H+ aquous plus hydroxide aquous yields water liquid that's the net ionic reaction for any strong acid and strong base everything else that's there is going to be a spectator ion so in this case that would be your your potassium ions your chloride ions those are going to be Spectators in this process so let's try an example with this a student adds one 50 Mill of 50 mol nitric acid to 300 milliliters of 3000 mol sodium hydroxide it asks us to give the net ionic equation The Spectator ions present after the reaction is over and to calculate the pH of the resulting mixture so for part A the net ionic equation well we just have to recognize that there's a strong acid being mixed with a strong base which which means the net ionic equation has to be this right here H+ plus o Nega equals or yields water and The Spectator ions would be all the other ions that are there that aren't part of that net ionic equation so that would be sodium and the nitrate those are your spectator ions now the harder part of this is part C we're going to calculate the pH of the resulting mixture I would strongly recommend that you calculate the moles of the H+ and O minus that are reacting and result from this reaction using a mole ice box now we've used ice boxes to work equilibrium problems this is not really an equilibrium problem but I think an ice box if we just use moles instead of marity actually uh can save us some time overd doing stochiometry and actually doing all the steps in the stochiometry so let's start with finding out how many moles of H+ we have initially now the H+ of course is coming from the strong acid and it's 150 milliliters of 0.5 molar so to find the moles of the H+ we just have to take the 0.15 L times .5 molar like we see here so that gives us 075 moles of H+ that's going to go in this initial spot right down here next we have moles of hydroxide I see that's 300 Mill of3 molar hydroxide so to find the moles I just multiply those two numbers by each other3 L time3 molar so that gives me 009 moles of hydroxide now there's a lot of water here this is an aquous solution we're not really concerned with how much water is made over the course of this process process we're just going to kind of ignore the water here in this uh in this scenario anyway so what we want to do is notice which one of these two items is going to run out well we have less H+ so it's going to run out first so in our change row this side will go down by 0075 since it's the limiting reactant it runs out first the hydroxide also goes down by 0075 leaving us with zero moles of H+ but when you subtract this we're left with 015 moles of hydroxide and we have to reason that since there's excess hydroxide the resulting solution when you mix these two things together will be basic it's going to have a pH greater than seven let's find out what that pH is so we had .015 moles of hydroxide we have to find out the marity of that so we divide it by liters and the liters will essentially be the sum of the two uh mixtures that were added together so we had over here we had 150 Ms over here there are 300 Ms so that's 450 Ms total so that's why we have to divide this by 450 lers to get the marity so when you divide that hopefully you see where that number came from it's just the sum of the two volumes and when you divide it out it's 00333 moles per liter hydroxide now if we know the concentration of hydroxide then if we take the negative log of that that's going to give us the P so that's 1.48 and if you know the p and the pH is pretty easy isn't it just subtract that from 14 and you'll find that the pH is 12.52 so that's how you solve a pH problem like this let's try another one there's a lot going on here so it's worth doing another problem this one says a student adds 290 milliliters of200 molar hbr hydrobromic acid to 185 Mill of50 molar berium hydroxide boh2 and once again it asks us for the same three things as we had in the last problem so the first part the net ionic equation is pretty straight forward since it's a strong acid being added to a strong base it's just the same as it was before H+ plus o minus yields water now by the way if you write this as h3o+ plus hydroxide yields two water molecules that's fine but this is how this is how most people actually write this uh in in chemistry but if you write it as h3o plus that's okay too now once again The Spectator ions are the ions that aren't doing anything so that would be the barium in the base and the bromide from the acid so those those are the spectators now this this leaves us with part C once again calculating the pH so we're going to use the ice box just like we did before this time it's with m though instead of a marity so the moles of hydrogen ions well we multiply 290 L times the2 molar hbr and when you multiply those out you find that the moles will be 0580 moles of hydrogen ions to find the moles of hydroxide we have to multiply 185 l time50 molar times 2 now you see that there's a time two here do you see why it has to be multiplied by two well this has two hydroxides in it so it's it's essentially a 2:1 ratio we have to account for that so when you multiply that out we get 0.0555 moles of hydroxide on a problem like this that is honestly the problem the most common mistake students forgetting to multiply by two because this is one of those strong bases that has two hydroxides in it like calcium hydroxide or stonum hydroxide it has the two now as we look at these two values we can see that looks like the hydroxide is the smaller value this time so that's the one that's going to run out first hydroxide is our limiting reactant and so that means that we're going to have zero moles of hydroxide but when you you subtract the H+ values we find that we have 0.0025 moles of hydrogen ions and that means that since we have excess hydrogen ions this is going to be not basic like in the last problem this is going to be an acidic resulting solution so we're going to take the .0025 moles of H+ that we just calculated and we're going to divide that by the total volume now do you see where the 475 L come from this time we had 290 milliliters and we added that to 185 milliliters so the total volume when you add these two together gets you 475 milliliters or that's our 475 lers so when you divide that out that's 0.53 molar and if you know the H+ concentration then to find the pH you just take the negative log of that H+ concentration just like we learned earlier on in in section one of this unit and so that's 2.28 and so that's all you have to do for a strong acid strong base problem now that's that's the most common type to be completely honest but you'll also sometimes have cases where you have a weak acid reacting with a strong base this is a fairly common type in fact we'll talk more about this in the next uh section section five about acidbase titrations and if you have a weak acid ionic equation is going to look something like this where ha is the formula of your weak acid of course hydroxide that's what's reacting out of the strong base the water is a product and this a minus here represents the conjugate base of the weak acid so basically it's just whatever the weak acid was starting with with an H+ taken away from it so that's the that's the template for writing the NIT onic equation for a weak acid strong base problem now usually what's going to happen in these problems is most likely you'll have a certain amount of acid and you'll have fewer moles of hydroxide than you have moles of the weak acid and so that means that all of the hydroxide reacts and what you're left with is a mixture of the weak acid this ha and the conjugate base the a minus so whenever you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base we call that a buffer and that's an important term to know a a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base we'll talk more about buffers toward the end of Unit 8 it's a very important concept something that's that's actually used quite a bit in in uh in chemistry so that's weak acid strong base now you could have another type of problem where a strong acid reacts with a weak base now this this this type is not quite as common in AP Chemistry but every but every now and then it does pop up if that happens this is the basic uh template for that type of equation in this case the strong acid I'm using the h3o plus that the hydronium to act as the strong acid that's aquous of course the weak base is just the B and that's aquous and the products are HB plus now that represents the conjugate acid of the weak base because this is the weak base the conjugate acid is just adding on an H plus to that basee essentially and of course water is uh produced as well so this is the template for writing a strong acid weak base reaction now once again most of the time if you see a problem like this you're going to have acid and of course the weak base and you're probably not going to have enough strong acid to react with all of the weak base and if that happens that means that what you're going to have is all of the hydronium reacting and so it's all essentially gone and you have a mixture of the weak base and its conjugate acid the B and the HB plus well that is also a buffer anytime you have a weak base and its conjugate acid or weak acid and its conjugate base that is a buffer and you probably know a few things about buffers already from perhaps earlier science classes buffers are solutions that resist changes to pH so that means you can add some acid or base to it and its pH is not going to change very much now your blood has a very important buffer in it so your your blood maintains a fairly constant pH we'll talk more about buffers later on in Unit 8 like I said earlier now let's take a look at a couple questions about the strength of acids and bases this one says the dissociation of cyanic acid is given below which of the two bases is stronger the CN negative ion or the water molecule explain your answer now the key part here to recognize is that this Ka is a fairly small number 3.5 * 10-4 that means that this reaction does not proceed forward in any appreciable amount uh since the value for KA is relatively small that means that this equilibrium lies far to the left you're going to have a whole lot more reactants than products so what that means is that this CN negative is very effective at accepting protons and we know that because we have a whole lot of hcn the CN negative has accepted lots and lots of protons evidently whereas water is not accepting a whole lot of protons we know that because you don't have a whole lot of CN negative produced this is a a two-way competing process we have a a forward process that is not proceeding very much but we have a reverse process that is proceeding quite a bit so in a a weak acid situation we'd say that its conjugate base is very good very strong I should say at accepting protons it's a stronger base than the water is let's look at another example which is is a stronger base in this example uh water or the nitrate ion and explain your answer well the giveaway on this one is that we're dealing with a strong acid dissociation on this one there really is no Ka because notice there's a single-headed arrow that means that this reaction essentially proceeds to completion so when that's the case notice that water is is a very good base because it is accepting every single one of the protons that nitric acid can throw at it it is an excellent base in this example whereas nitrate is a pathetic base it's not really acting as a very good base at all and that's because it it can't accept any of these protons that hydronium might be throwing at it and you see that that's essentially what the explanation is saying here water accepts protons very well uh nitrate is very ineffective so water is the stronger base so the takeaway from this is that when a strong acid is reacting with water well water is an excellent base in this example I hope this video has helped you to learn something about how strong acids and strong bases and weak acids and and and strong bases and and and other and that other type strong acids and weak bases react uh sometimes hard to keep it all straight in my head but hope you uh learned something from this if you did please smash that Thumbs Up Button smash the like button and I hope to see you

discussion of AP Chemistry Unit 8 section five which is all about acidbase titrations there's a lot going on here so it's going to take me three videos to get through through this section but uh we're going to be able to uh to understand this just fine once we get through those if you haven't yet subscribed to my channel consider clicking that uh subscribe button that way you won't miss a thing of all my 100 plus AP Chemistry daily videos as well as AP review videos and probably walkthroughs all kinds of good things there as we jump into acidbase titrations you might remember that we just barely stuck our toe into this back in unit four uh specifically an acidbase titration is a method of determining the precise concentration in marity of an acid or a base and the way this works is we put a solution normally it's the base into a buet which is a long slender tube and we put a precise amount of the the other solution which is normally the acid into an Erin Meer flask down below and then we also put some acidbase indicator into that flax down below that way we'll know when the reaction is complete uh and when you dispense the solution from that buet eventually the uh the acid solution down below the mixture changes color and then you know that the reaction is done that's called the end point so this is what that looks like like here is your bued up top and here's your Erin Meer flask and like I said you'll probably put a few drops of acidbase indicator into the flask as well that way you know that when the color changes the reaction is done now the moment at which the moles of acid equal the moles of Base that's your equivalence point notice we have that here and the moment when the color changes is called the end point and some students will confuse those two know that there is a difference the equivalence point is a stochiometric point the end point is what we see with our eyes and so there there is a difference there we're going to work a few problems with titrations today but the first problem that we're going to work with the first series of problems has to do with what I call the titration equation m a VA equals MB VB and this is how we can calculate the amount of volume of a acid or a base we're going to need in order to get to the equivalence point now the M Suba stands for the marity of the acid and that's uh that may be given to us in the problem we might have to calculate that whatever the case may be V sub a is the volume of that acid m subb is the marity of the base and then V subb is the volume of the base of course marity is moles per liter volume is normally going to be in milliliters and it is okay to leave it in milliliters in this equation as long as you're consistent with your units there is a little caveat to this equation though if you're working with an acid or more commonly a base that has multiple basic or acidic units on it like calcium hydroxide for example has two hydroxide units well you need to place that multiple of of two in this case in front of the term for that side if it's a base you put it in front of the base side we'll see an example of that here in a moment let's try this equation or this problem in the lab a chemist titrates .150 molar sodium hydroxide solution into a flask containing 10 milliliters of 350 mol acetic acid what volume of base is required to reach the equivalence point of the titration so once again we're going to use this titration equation and we're just going to plug and chug to solve for the answer the marity of the acid is given to us in the problem it says the acid this acetic acid here is 350 molar so that goes in for M Suba the volume of the acid is also given to us it's 10 milliliters so that goes in for V sub a and then m subb is the marity of the base that's given to us in the problem the base is sodium hydroxide so that's .150 molar and then volume of the base VB that's what we're solving for it asks us what volume of base is required so that's our unknown so this is just a simple algebra problem when you take 35 * 10 and divide by 0.15 you get the correct answer of about 23 3.3 millit as your answer so that's how much base it should take to get to the equivalence point let's try another example in an acidbase titration it requires 36.4 milliliters of calcium hydroxide to reach the end point when being titrated into 15.00 milliliters of 3000 molar HCL what is the concentration of the calcium hydroxide solution and you might realize that maybe I should have said equivalence point right sometimes we use them interchangeably when maybe we shouldn't anyway we're going to plug and chug into the equation m a VA equals MB VB but I want you to notice something we're working with calcium hydroxide and this is one of those strong bases that has two hydroxide units along with it which means we're going to have to put a two right here in the equation to make the stochiometry work out just realize that sometimes you have to do that now we can work the problem as usual the marity of the acid is given to us it's 3000 molar of our acid so that goes in for M Suba the V Suba the volume of the acid is 15 milliliters so that goes in for V Suba then the marity of the base well that's what we're solving for it says hydroxide so I'm going to leave my two there of course and then m subb is what I'm solving for V subb is the volume of the base and it says 36.4 8 milliliters so that's going to be the volume of the base so now we just have to solve the problem solve for M subb so. 3 * 15 IDE 2 divide by 36.4 and you'll find that the answer is m subb equal 0617 molar calcium hydroxide so that's how you use the titration equation now we're going to look at a couple different types of titrations in this video and the next video as well and the one after it too and the first type is a strong acid strong base titration now in the lab atory in AP Chemistry this is probably not the most common one to work with but this is the easiest one so we're going to start with this um don't forget that when you add a strong acid to a strong base the net ionic equation is always the same this is just like we did uh in uh in our last video in section four a strong acid strong base will always be H+ plus o minus yields water so that makes it a little bit easier because you know that the net ionic equation is always that so you just write that down now don't forget that there's only really one product here the product and and the only product is pure water in its liquid form so that means that the pH at the equivalence point that's the point where the moles of acid equal moles of Base will always be seven as long as you're at 25° C that's the equivalence point at that temperature so it'll be seven now let's take a look at this problem right here it says that in a titration .200 molar sodium hydroxide is titrated into 40 milliliters of 01000 molar HCL hydrochloric acid determine the amount of sodium hydroxide required to reach the equivalence point and calculate the pH of the mixture after 20 Millers of sodium hydroxide have been added so to solve part A we need to use the titration equation m a vaal MB VB and just plug and chug into this so the marity of the acid is given to us in the problem it's 0.10 molar so I'm going to plug that in there the volume of the acid it says we're titrating into 40 milliliters of this acid so 40 milliliters is our V Suba our M subb is2 moles per liter so that goes in there for the marity of the base we're trying to determine the amount of sodium hydroxide required so V subb is going to be our unknown so we're going to leave that as VB now we just have to solve using algebra and when you multiply 40 * 0.1 and then divide that by 0. 2 you'll find that your V subb is 20 millit and so it's going to take 20 milliliters to get to the equivalence point point now Part B asks calculate the pH of this mixture after 20 Mill of sodium hydroxide have been added well we know that 20 milliliters that's the equivalence point isn't it we just calculated that so at the equivalence point in a strong acid strong based titration the pH is always seven isn't it as long as we're at 25 deges C so that's the answer it is 7. now very often it's useful to take a look at a graph of how the pH changes over the course of the titration so this is something called a titration curve and notice that on the x axis we have the volume of a base that has been added and on the y- AIS we have pH so in our titration curve notice that we start very very low because in our flask down below we have a strong acid so your pH will be pretty close to zero and as we add the base the pH goes up slowly notice how it goes up slowly and slowly and slowly and then at a certain point it just shoots up and we'll talk about why that happens here in a later video but notice that at some point it just shoots up and then it keeps on going up more gradually after that it's almost like an S curve here it looks like a big letter s well in that curve notice there is a point kind of in the exact middle point of that s that's called the inflection point and that inflection point in this titration curve denotes the pH of the equivalence point so if we take that that that that inflection point and just kind of drag it drag it over here to the left you'll notice that that inflection point that equivalence point is at ph7 and so that's one of the ways that we just can look at this titration curve and see that this is a strong acid strong base curve because it's inle point is at ph7 I hope you've learned something about our introduction to um to titrations here if you've learned something please uh smash that like button hope to see you in my next video where we're going to move on and talk about uh titrations including strong bases and weak acids hope to see you then,"6,428",0,85

"Special Types of Acid-Base Titrations - AP Chem Unit 8, Topic 5c","In this video, Mr. Krug discusses two special types of titrations that are often addressed on the AP Chemistry exam:  titrations involving polyprotic acids and the standardization of a base using a primary standard.  00:00  Special Titration 1 - Polyprotic Acids 05:46  Special Titration 2 - Standardization of a Base 08:53  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4SChFPWJ5g&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=87,hi there I'm Jeremy krog and in this video we're looking at some advanced concepts in acid-based titrations in AP Chemistry Unit 8 section five here we in this picture we have a a titration curve for a polyprotic acid and on the x axis you see that we have the volume or the milliliters of the sodium hydroxide that has been added and of course on the y- axis we have the pH now you'll notice that this titration curve looks significantly different than the two curves that we looked at in our two previous videos so why are there two S curves here why are there two equivalence points in these last two that we looked at in the previous videos each tiation curve only had one well if there are two equivalence points that must mean that there are two acidic hydrogens that are being popped off or being removed uh in sequence and so that implies that we have a diprotic acid there are two acidic hydrogens each one has its own equivalence point let's use this information in the curve to estimate the pka1 of this acid so in order to do that we're going to need to look at the halfway point between the starting point and that first equivalence point like you might remember in the last video we said that at the halfway point between where you start and your equivalence point at the halfway point that's equal to the pka so here's your first equivalence point so halfway is right around here and so that's why I have it listed as about 2.2 you may have estimated that a little higher a little lower but it's about 2.2 halfway to the first equivalence point that's actually pretty neat that we can estimate the pka and as it turns out the KA as well from just looking at that titration curve now let's estimate the pka2 of this acid now once again that's going to be halfway point but this time it's the halfway point between the first equivalence point and the second equivalence point so that's going to be right around here somewhere and so if we move over to the left it looks like it's somewhere around maybe 6.4 somewhere around that area so it's halfway between the two equivalence points so that's how you can use a titration curve like this to determine a Ka in fact multiple Ka uh in the case of this polyprotic acid now let's imagine that this acid is h3po4 phosphoric acid that's this is probably a pretty good estimate because as it turns out uh in phosphoric acid you would probably see two hydrogens uh be removed over the course of the reaction well what is the most common ion form present after 8 milliliters of Base have been added well let's just take a look at at how these uh work here how these ions are removed and the way this works is in between the zero and the first halfway point so that would be right around here from zero to that point right there the most common form is going to be the H3 po4 now at that first halfway point you're going to have exactly as much H3 po4 as you have H2 P4 negative but once you get past that first halfway point in fact from that halfway point right there all the way to the next halfway point right around here from this point to that point the most common form is going to be H2 P4 negative because that first acidic hydrogen has been taken away so the answer here is H2 P4 negative that's what's going to predominate after 5 MERS up until the 15 m point now what's going to predominate after that point let's say we're asking about the 18mil point well from this point right here that second halfway point up until the equivalence point right around here what's going to predominate is going to be the next form that's been taken off HP4 2 negative and that's what's going to predominate from the 15 Ms up till 20 Ms now why just 20 what happens after that well after that your acid is basically used up and what predominates after the last equivalence point in pretty much any titration if you're adding sodium hydroxide well it's just hydroxide ions and that's why this pH level shoots up so quickly and stays so high so consistently after that last equivalence point because hydroxide is your primary component after the last uh equivalence point in that titration so that's just a little map of how this titration curve works and what predominates at what point in the titration let's take a look at a different type of titration this is kind of a special type this is uh something that we use often in analytical chemistry and often we use a solid or a weak acid in its solid form and titrate that with a strong base now solid weak acids are what we often called primary standards uh in fact the probably the most common one that I can think of is a compound called potassium hydrogen phalate we sometimes just call that khp and it's used to determine the concentration of a base solution that we're going to use in the lab like for example if I go into the lab and make up sodium hydroxide I don't really know exactly what its concentration is until I carry out a standardization and I standardize or determine what the concentration of that sodium hydroxide is and that's what the primary standard is for so let's take a look at the data for that experiment that we would use for this in the laboratory a chemist weighs out 0.829 G of khp primary standard and dissolves it in water in a flask it requires 32.5 6 M of sodium hydroxide solution to reach the end point what is the marity of that sodium hydroxide solution very typical experiment that you would do in the analytical chemistry lab well the first thing we have to do is take this khp amount and convert it to moles so 8293 G of khp well we conver it to moles one mole on top and 24.2 G in a mole on bottom and don't forget that the formula is k h C8 h44 so that's that's quite a bit to add up um but we just add that up and that there's our molar mass and when you divide this out you find that it's 0.462 moles of the acid now that's the moles of the acid how many moles of the the base the sodium hydroxide do we use well we have to remember that we're assuming that the end point which it mentions right here is very close to the equivalence point and so if that's the case then the number of moles of acid should be equal to the moles of the base as well so that means that in our sample of sodium hydroxide we also had 0.462 moles and we divide that by the volume in liters which is 03256 L you know convert the milliliters to liters and when you divide it out you get that the marity of your sodium hydroxide solution is1 1248 moles per liter it's a fairly simple process but it's a very important process in the analytical chemistry lab hope you learned something about acid-based titrations in this video and the last few videos as well in our next video we're going to move on to uh section six which is going to be about how we know the strength or the relative

"Molecular Structure of Acids and Bases - AP Chem Unit 8, Topic 6","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students several of the factors that affect the strength of acids and bases, many of which concern the molecular structure of the acid or base molecule.  He also emphasizes the relationship between the strength of an acid and the strength of its conjugate base.  00:00  Coulomb's Law & Acid Strength 02:20  Strength of an Acid vs Its Conjugate Base 05:02  Other Rules for Acid Strength 08:40  Practice Questions 10:17  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NECIQ2Wp1m0&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=88,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this video we're going to look at AP Chemistry Unit 8 section six which is all about the relative strength and weaknesses of acids and there are a few different rules that we can use to help us understand how strong or how weak an acid is going to be one rule that helps us with this is koloms law now I know we've talked about koloms law quite a bit already in this course but this this actually does help us here um you might notice that here I have the hydrogen halides we have HF HCL hbr and hi and you might understand already that three of these are strong acids aren't they HCL hbr and hi but for some reason HF is not a strong acid it is a weak acid and why is that well it has to do with kul's law if you have two atoms that are very small then they can get very very close to each other so h and f are both very small atoms so they can get very close to each other and because they have that small distance between them they have a very strong interatomic attraction that's kum's law that's the distance part of the of that equation that's the D part of kul's Law and as a result of that since there's a strong attraction this H right here is not going to fall off or be removed as readily as it will for the others so that's the reason why HF is a weak acid and all your other hydrogen halides are strong acids now as you move to the right you notice that the atoms that hydrogen Associates it with here are uh much larger in fact iodine is the largest of these four as we see so that means that even though all three of these HCL hbr and hi are strong acids we can say that hi is actually the strongest of those acids because of the relatively large distance between those two atoms we can say that hi is going to be the strongest of those and hbr is a little bit weaker even though it's a strong acid too HC a little bit weaker HF is the weakest of all of those now one thing that we mentioned earlier that we uh would bear repeating is that the stronger the acid the weaker the conjugate base we actually did some mathematical calculations in an earlier video in this unit to show why that's the case but as you can see hi is a very strong acid so that means that hi is going to release H+ it's going to donate protons very very easily isn't it whereas its conjugate base iodide it could not attract a proton to save its life in a matter of speaking so I minus is going to be a very very weak base and as we talk about acids getting weaker like HF is a little bit weaker well that means fluoride is a little bit of a stronger base isn't it and then we start to get to some very weak acids like like hcn that means cyanide is a fairly strong base and of course water water isn't really much of an acid or a base is it it's not that great of an acid most of the time anyway well hydroxide is a fairly strong base isn't it so the the weaker the acid the stronger its conjugate base and likewise the stronger the acid the weaker its conjugate base now if you prefer you can imagine this as a competition for H pluses for protons if you take a look at these two equations here we see that in this case chloride is not doing a a very good job of attracting hydrogens at all and we see that because there's only a single-headed arrow here it doesn't even go in that other direction CH chloride can't attract any hydrogen ions that get thrown at it so it is a pathetic base on the other hand nitrite attracts hydrogen ions very well in fact it attracts it is able to to keep most of the protons most of the H+ is that get thrown at it from hydronium and we know that because there's a whole lot more hno2 than there is NO2 minus that's because this equilibrium lives to the left so you can think about it as a competition for protons a really uh good base a really awful base so in this case uh water is actually a better base than chloride is whereas over here water is not nearly as good of a base as nitrite would be now there are some other rules for acid strength that you need to know about for the AP Chemistry uh course the first rule is that if you have an acid that has a hydrogen an oxygen and then some other atom we'll just call it X the more electr negative that that atom X is the stronger the acid is going to be and the reason for that is that electrons are going to drift toward that electronegative atom and that's going to allow the hydrogen to essentially leave so in these three cases here we have HX type compounds well we know that Florine is very electronegative right looking at the periodic table it's the most electronegative of of all the atoms on the periodic table so guess what HF is the strongest of those three acids chlorine is also rather electronegative so it's going to be the next strongest of these three and iodine is the lowest electr negativity of these three so it would be the weakest of those three acids so stronger electr negativity in a combination like this implies a a stronger acid here's another rule if you have an acid with h one or more oxygen and then another atom which we'll call X the more oxygens the acid has the stronger the acid's going to be and that's because oxygen oxygen just unto itself is a very electronegative atom and so the electrons are going to drift toward those oxygens and that's going to allow the the hydrogen to pop off or to leave so if we have this combination here or these these three acids they all have H and cl but they have different numbers of oxygens well the one that has the most oxygen is the strongest so that's H4 and that makes sense because perchloric acid is a strong acid isn't it we actually have that on our list of the big six and then hcl2 chlorus acid would be the next strongest and then HCL or HCL however you want to write that hypochlorous acid is a fairly weak acid and we see that because it has fewer oxygens now now sometimes you'll be asked to uh talk about the strength of weak organic acids now organic acids this is not something that we talk about much in AP Chemistry but if you see a molecule that has this rough structure to it has a carbon double bonded to an oxygen and then that carbon Bond or that carbon atom is double is bonded to an O group here um and then the carbon is also bonded to something else that we'll call R uh this this is an organic acid this R is probably some sort of organic group maybe a uh ch3 or some other carbon hydrogen uh combination this is an organic acid you'll have a CO tail on the end of it and the more electron negative the atoms in this R Group the stronger the acid and the reason for that is that if this R is more electr negative the electrons are going to drift toward that R it's going to allow the hydrogen to pop off in that case so let's do a few examples here in each pair of compounds below which is the stronger acid well we'll start with the first one here we have two organic acids and hopefully you can see that there's an F here which is very Electro negative whereas hydrogen's not that Electro negative so that means the first choice is going to be more electronegative and the stronger acid in Part B here we have ho and then something else in each of these acids whichever one is more electronegative that's the stronger acid and I believe chlorine is a bit more electronegative than bromine so that means H should be the stronger of those two acids in part C we have H2S SO3 and h2so4 so if the only thing that's different is the number of oxygens well whichever one has more oxygens will be stronger right so that means h2so4 is the stronger acid that makes sense too because sulfuric acid is one of our big six strong acids the last one here hi and HCL well they're both strong acids aren't they but but technically which one's a little bit stronger well it would have to be hi because the distance between H and I is larger or or longer than the distance between H and cl you know because I is just a larger atom and cl is a smaller atom I hope you've

"pH and pKa - Analyzing Titration Curves - AP Chem Unit 8, Topic 7","In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to analyze a titration curve.  Using a titration curve, it is possible to describe what kind of titration is being carried out, the approximate pH of the equivalence point, and even the pKa and Ka of the weak acid involved in the titration.  Mr. Krug will cover all of these points in this video.  Finally, he will show how to choose an appropriate indicator for an acid-base titration.  00:00  Introduction 00:13  Titration Curve Analysis 03:36  Acid-Base Indicators 05:46  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtP2__hS1QE&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=89,hi there I'm Jeremy Krug and in this video we're going to be moving right along to AP Chemistry Unit 8 section 7 which is about the relationship between pH and PKA especially in acidbase titrations so let's start by just looking at the titration curve for a strong base added to a weak acid so once again we have the volume of Base that's been added on the x-axis and the change in pH is represented on the the Y AIS and as you can see we start out with that pH Rising fairly slowly and then all of a sudden we get to the point where it just shoots up and then it starts to continue up not quite as fast but it goes up uh fairly fairly quickly after that as well so I want you to notice that just like we said before the inflection point denotes the equivalence point now even if they didn't tell you you should be able to tell that this is a strong base weak acid titration and that's because the equivalence point that that inflection point right there has a pH greater than seven so that greater than seven implies that the base is going to predominate that's why we say strong base weak acid in that case now we also learned another point about this graph already we know that at halfway to the equivalence point the concentration of the weak acid is equivalent or equal to the concentration of the conjugate base and because of that we'll talk about that in our next video but because of that at that particular point the pH of the solution is equal to the pka or the negative log of the KA of that acid and so at that point ha the the acid concentration equals the con base concentration now let's look at what predominates on either side of that halfway point because of that you know when you have any point before the halfway point what predominates is the acid you have more ha more of the weak acid you only have a little bit of ha in fact we can take that to its logical beginning there at the very beginning of the titration we haven't added any base at all have we so the only thing you have is ha now let's take that to the other side if you go past the halfway point and before the equivalence point in this this region right here what you have is more conjugate base than the acid so that's what's going to predominate once you get to the equivalence point you just have have the weak base there now what's going to predominate after the equivalence point well let's think about it notice where the pH is it's very high and think about what we're adding to this as well so because of that I think it's safe to say that the substance that predominates here is the hydroxide and so that's what's going to predominate from basically past the equivalence point lots of hydroxides still being added there that's when you have what's called overshooting your titration now when you are carrying out an acidbase titration always make sure to use the most appropriate acidbase indicator and in your chemical closet or your Chemical stock room there's a good chance that you have several acidbase indicators available to you there are dozens if not more out there on the market every acidbase indicator has a a specific pH at which it transitions from one color to another uh for example litmus which you've heard of before it transitions around pH 7.0 that means that at pH is below 7.0 it's red at pH is greater than 7.0 it's blue its PKA is 7.0 for methyl Orange it's about 3.4 for phenol thaline it's around 9.4 so that transition that transition pH that's the pka so let's imagine that we're trying to titrate a strong acid with a strong base which of the three indicators would you choose well remember a strong acid and a strong base are going to have an equivalence point right in the middle right at seven right so that means that we're looking at a indicator or trying to find an indicator that has a pka of around seven so litmus is your best choice on that one now what about a weak acid and a strong base which indicator would you use then well if you have a strong base and a weak acid well then that the base is going to predominate and your equivalence point is going to be on the basic side probably around nine somewhere in that area so you'll want a an acidbase indicator that transitions around fine and so the best choice here is phenol phine that's the one that you'd want to use so use the pka of these indicators to determine which indicator to use in a certain titration not always going to be the same hope you learned something about pH and PKA in this video if you did go ahead and slam that like button I'm Jeremy kug and our next video we're going to move on to uh Unit 8 sections 8 n and 10 and wrap up this unit by talking

He finishes up the video by showing how the molarity of solutions can be manipulated to control buffer capacity.  00:00  Introduction 00:21  Properties of Buffers - Topic 8.8 02:56  Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation - Topic 8.9 09:24  Buffer Capacity - Topic 8.10 11:30  Conclusion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8kHwEN4SbM&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=90,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this AP Chemistry video we're going to wrap up Unit 8 by taking a look at sections 8 n and 10 now that seems like quite a bit to handle in one video but these are all about the same concept the concept of buffer Solutions so we're going to take a look at these now we've already talked about buffers a little bit already in this course we've already said that buffers are a special type of acidbase mixture essentially a buffer is what you get when you have a weak acid mixed with its conjugate base U now likewise it could also be a weak base and its conjugate acid that essentially works out to be kind of the same thing but the fact is you got to have something like that a weak acid conjugate base something like that and the reason that we're going to create a buffer solution in the laboratory is because the buffer Solutions tend to resist pH change there are certain reactions in the lab where you need to maintain the pH at a certain level in order for the reaction to take place effectively so you'll possibly put a buffer in there to maintain that fairly consistent pH as an example of this your blood has a buffer and this buffer maintains the pH of your blood at about 7.4 sometimes it goes a little bit higher or a little bit lower but generally speaking your physiological pH is very close to 7.4 so let's take a look at this example here it says which of the following mixtures would form a buffer once again we're looking for something that has a weak acid and it's conjugate base that's automatically going to eliminate the second choice because that's a strong base and a weak base so that certainly does not qualify the answer is the third one isn't it because acetic acid is a weak acid and then acetate ion would be its conjugate base so that's the answer now what's wrong with the first example well notice that sulfuric acid is not a weak acid is it it's a strong acid and so this is actually not going to be an effective buffer it has to be a weak acid not a strong acid a weak acid and it's conjugate base now the way that a buffer works is you have this this uh mix Ure of a weak acid and its conjugate base if you were to add acid to the buffer the acid is going to react with the base in the buffer and likewise if you have a base that you add to the buffer it's going to react with the acid so essentially no matter what you do you can add acid to the buffer you can add base to the buffer uh either way it's going to maintain pretty close to that same uh pH let's move on to section 8.9 which is about how to calculate the pH of a buffer so here's an example we may have a problem like this where it says a student obtains 250 milliliters of a buffer containing 60 molar hydrochloric acid and20 molar sodium fluoride calculate the pH of this buffer now there's an equation that we use for this now I'm not going to worry about deriving the equation for you but this is called the Henderson Hassel balk equation and this is a very useful equation to help us to determine the pH of a buffer now of course the pH is well the pH of the buffer the pka is the negative log of the KA of that weak acid so you'll need to know or look up the KA in order to solve that part of the question now over here the a negative concentration that represents the concentration of the conjugate base in the buffer likewise the the ha in Brackets represents the concentration of the weak acid in the buffer solution so let's go ahead and and use this equation to plug and chug and find the answer so once again we're solving for the pH uh we're going to have to look up the KA I believe the KA of hydrochloric acid is 7.2 * 10 -4 so that gets plugged in for KA and then in this other term we have plus log and then the base the conjugate base is the the fluoride and that's where the 020 gets plugged in and then the hydrofluoric acid is of course our ha that's the acid part of this so the 60 gets plugged into the denominator there so now all we have to do is determine what this is equal to on our calculator so the first term is 3.14 the log of. 2 over6 is .48 so when you compare compute this you'll find that the pH of the buffer is 2.66 so it's a fairly straightforward problem if you're pretty good with your scientific calculator and are able to work with the logarithm button then you shouldn't have any problem solving these problems let's try another example this one might be a little bit tougher this one says a chemist needs to produce a buffer with ph8.0 if he has access to a solution of 50 molar Hy hpoc chlorus acid which has a Ka of 3.0 * 108 what concentration of sodium hypochlorite na a should be used in the buffer so once again we're talking about the pH of a buffer so you want to use the Henderson Hassel balk equation pH equals PKA plus log of the conjugate base over the concentration of the acid so we're just going to plug and chug in here we know what the desired pH is it's 8.00 so I'm going to plug that in for pH right there now the problem tells me what the KA is it's 3.0 * 10 the8 so that goes in for KA so PKA is just a negative log of that number now in this other term the conj uh the concentration of the base is what we are trying to find we don't know what the concentration of the hypochlorite should be so that's our unknown now in the denominator we do know what the concentration of the weak acid is it's 50 so that's going to go into the denominator and now we just have an algebra problem to solve sometimes it seems a little bit harder because we do have u a logarithm to deal with but we can still work our way through that so on this term here the negative log of the KA is 7.52 so I'm going to go ahead and evaluate that and I'm trying to isolate the variable so I'm going to subtract 7.52 from both sides and so I get 0.48 equals the log of the base over 0.5 now to simplify this further I'm going to take the anti-log of both sides that's what your 10 to the x button on your calculator is so that's going to get rid of this log here on the right side I'll have to take anti-log of 048 so I find that 3.00 equals the concentration of the base over 050 and so now to solve for the unknown I just have to multiply 3 * .5 and so the answer is 1.50 moles per liter so that is the desired concentration of sodium hypochloride I would need in order to have that buffer right around pH 8.00 now as you look at the equation you might realize that uh KA for an acid at a particular temperature is not really going to change it's fairly non-negotiable if you're dealing with a certain acid but you might notice that it is a little bit negotiable to change the ratio of the base to the acid and if you're a little bit mathematical in thinking you might realize well hang on here if the base is 1.5 molar and the acid was 0.5 molar that's just a ratio of 3 to one isn't it so what would happen if we just changed the concentrations and maintained the same ratio What If instead of using 1.5 molar base and .5 molar acid we just used solutions that were more dilute like .03 molar hypochlorite and 0.01 molar hypochlorous acid would that give us the same pH well yes it would because as long as the the ratio of the base to the acid is 3:1 we're going to have the same pH aren't we so maybe you're wondering why don't we do that why don't we just make all of our buffer Solutions have very dilute concentrations that way we still have the same pH and we don't have to worry about spending more money to make more concentrated Solutions well there's a problem with that and this is where section 8.10 comes in this is an idea called buffer capacity and the fact is the more dilute your Solutions are the less they're going to be able to withstand the addition of acid or base that's the buffer capacity so the idea here is that using higher concentration buffer components like that 1.50 to .50 as opposed to 0.03 and 0.001 while keeping the ratios constant we'll keep the pH at the same level but it's going to increase the capacity of that buffer to neutralize added acid or base so that's why when we're making a buffer if you really wanted to to neutralize a significant amount of added acid or base you're going to make the concentrations a little bit higher while keeping that ratio the same like in our example earlier it was a 3 to one now if you find a buffer that has more conjugate acid than base then that buffer is going to be able to absorb more base without changing its pH significantly because that acid that conjugate acid is going to react with the base now on the other hand if you have a buffer with more conjugate base than acid it's going to be able to significantly absorb more acid because likewise the base is going to react with the acid without changing its pH significantly so so if we roll back to the example that we just had here in our last example we see that the base was 1.5 and the acid was only 0.5 so is this particular buffer going to be more effective at a neutralizing acid or base well you can see that since there's more base it's going to be better at neutralizing Acid because base reacts with acid so hopefully you can see the concept behind buffer capacity here I hope you learned something about buffers and about acids and bases if you did go ahead and slam that like button and I hope to see you in my next video where we're going to move right on to unit 9 which is about applications of thermodynamics join me then,"10,853",0,90
"What You Need to Know About Entropy - AP Chem Unit 9, Topic 1","#apchem #apchemistry #thermodynamics   In this video, Mr. Krug defines entropy and then shows students how to compare the entropies of different systems, based on the state of matter, temperature, and number of molecules present.  Finally, he works several examples predicting the sign of ΔS of a balanced chemical equation.  00:00  What Is Entropy? 01:17  Comparing Entropy of Different Systems 07:28  Example Number 1 08:17  Predicting the Sign of ΔS - Practice",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVLShoOjTc&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=91,Unit Nine in AP Chemistry is actually two little units the first half of this is about the second law of Thermodynamics and the second half is about electrochemistry so as we start unit 9 section one we're talking about entropy and what this is now as you can see here the letter or the variable that we use to talk about entropy is s we've talked about this a bit in Unit S but we're going to talk about it much more here in Unit Nine now entropy if you were to look this up in a physics book or in a chemistry textbook or maybe even in the dictionary you'd find that entropy is defined as the quantity of possible energy states of the components of a system and so in in other words the more possible energy states that molecules can have the higher the entropy is going to be now a colloquial and to be completely honest for AP Chemistry a definition that is just as good is the amount of disorder in a system or the amount of Chaos in a system if you remember this you're probably going to get the answer right every time if you're answering the questions about which one which uh system has more order or disorder now what we're talking about when we say order or disorder is if you take a look at a solid we've learned already in this course uh way back in those earlier units that in a solid you have a very nice orderly often a very crystalline arrangement of molecules very orderly a solid has very little entropy in fact of all the states of matter solid is going to have the lowest entropy of them all now if you move up to a liquid well you know what a liquid is like the the molecules are a little bit farther apart they have a little bit more freedom to move around they can slip and slide around each other and so in a liquid there's more disorder there's more there are more possible energy states in those molecules so we'd say that in a liquid we have more entropy than we'd have in a solid solid is the least liquid is higher now think about a gas in a gas you have molecules that are moving all over the place right they have the most freedom of motion molecules are for all practical purposes independent of each other they can go pretty much wherever they want to go in a gas and so as a result we have a whole lot more chaos a whole lot more entropy in a gas so if you're thinking about the three main states of matter solids have the least entropy liquids have somewhere in the middle and gas has the highest amount of entropy now let's visualize this in the real world and how you might imagine this here we have a picture of a uh a hotel that no longer exists and it as you can see it's all nice and orderly we have a bunch of uh rooms in this hotel it has floors and then after something happens to the hotel perhaps an implosion when they decide to destroy the hotel here's what you have left over so as you can see we have an increase in entropy so it went from this very orderly or this very low entropy State over here on the left to a much higher entropy State over here on the right a whole lot more disorder and you can probably imagine that in order to get from the first state to the second state it doesn't take a whole lot of energy now it does take some energy it takes maybe some sticks of dynamite that are placed in the right locations it might take some sort of of other U you know some chemical reaction but in order to get from the left state to the right State it's actually pretty simple now if you go from the right state to a restoration of the left-hand State here is that going to be very easy to accomplish and you probably know that it's not it would almost be impossible to go from this very high entropy State on the right and restore the hotel to what it looked like before the implosion so as you can see it's more natural or it's easier to go from a low entropy state to a higher entropy State than the other way around most of the time and we'll talk more about this later on now here's another example here's a what looks to be a pretty nice looking house mansion of some kind and then if we were to just abandon that house well after maybe 10 or 20 years this is what that same house looks like as you can see once again very nice and orderly originally in the second state it is a whole lot more disorderly it has more entropy so we say that once again this is increasing entropy and once again I will ask you to think about the following it is a whole lot easier for the first state to go to the second state isn't it than to go in reverse all you have to do in order for the first condition to become the second condition is to abandon the house you don't have to do a whole lot on the other hand if you want to go from the second state and restore the house to its former glory well you're going to have to invest a lot of energy aren't you so once again we can see that it's generally speaking easier to go from a low entropy state to a higher entropy State than the reverse we'll talk more about this in a future lesson now as we think about the entropy in a system over the course of a chemical reaction or a physical process process we need to remember that the entropy and of course s represents entropy the entropy of a gas is the highest of them all that is the highest entropy state that you can have in a chemical reaction for all practical purposes then if you have an aquous solution it's a little bit less because you have ions swimming around in a solvent and so that's going to have more entropy than a pure liquid like just a bottle of sealed water or something like that and of course that's going to have a higher entropy than a solid solids are the lowest and so that's the hierarchy of entropy whenever we're thinking about states and matter solid is the lowest then liquid aquous is the second highest and of course gas is the highest and if we're thinking about just in terms of temperature systems at a higher temperature are going to have a higher or a greater entropy than systems at a lower temperature so if you heat something something up well you're increasing the entropy if you cool something down you're decreasing the entropy as long as you're not changing states how about no change in state at all well for systems where there is no change in state or temperature this is where you have to count the particles systems with more particles have greater entropy than those with fewer particles so let's take a look at this example the diagrams below represent two gases at the same temperature which of them has greater entropy explain your answer well they're both gases so we can't say that you know one is a gas one's a solids that that's not going to answer the question and they're at the same temperature so temperature doesn't help so the tiebreaker in that case is the number of molecules and so as you can see the the picture on the right here the one that has the green molecule has a much larger number of molecules than the state on the left and so if two systems are at the same temperature and in the same state the one with more particles will have the greater entropy so the gas on the right has greater entropy let's try a few examples here where we have predicting or we're asked to predict the sign of Delta s or the change in entropy for each of the following reactions so let's see how this is done well in this case you can see that we're going from carbon dioxide solid which has a low entropy to carbon dioxide gas which has a higher entropy so solid to gas well that's an increase in entropy isn't it so we're going to call that a positive Delta s sign how about this reaction we have HCL gas plus ammonia gas yields ammonium chloride solid well in this case we're moving from gas molecules which have a high entropy down to solid or a solid state which has the lowest entropy SO gas down to solid that's a drop in entropy isn't it so that's why we'd say this has a negative sign for Delta H let's try this one in this case we have a couple ions that are in the aquous state and they're moving to the solid state well which direction is that well we said that aquous is a pretty high entropy State isn't it in fact it's second only to gas solid is the lowest so if we're going from aquous down to solid that's a drop in entropy isn't it so that would be a negative sign for Delta s here we have another case this time we have a solid and it's moving to a mixture between solid and gas so what's that going to be well if it's all solid that's way down here at the bottom isn't it whereas solid and gas well gas is certainly higher than just solid by itself so this is going to be an increase in entropy as well because we have a gas being produced from a solid one more example here in this case we have two sulfur dioxide gas plus oxygen gas yields two sulfur trioxide gas as you can see the state of matter is not going to help us is it because it's gas to gas so what's the tiebreaker well we count the molecules and as we can see here on the left side we have three molecules two of these plus one of this so that's three molecules on the left side and on the right side we have two molecules so it's going from three to two so three molecules to two that sounds like a drop in entropy isn't it since we're dropping the number of molecules so that's a negative Delta s if you use these principles you should be able to determine the sign of Delta s for pretty much any reaction now if you were ever to find a reaction where there were uh perhaps gases and you had three moles on the left side and three moles on the right side well in that case it'll be pretty hard to tell the sign wouldn't it we'd have to take a guess that the Delta s is going to be pretty close to zero in that case hope you learned something from this video if you did please slam that like button button and I hope to see you in the next video where we're going to learn some more about entropy and thermodynamics hope to see you then,"4,690",0,91

https://krugslist.files.wordpress.com...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUYUFrgoIOg&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=94,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this video we're going to take a look at the next part of unit 9 section three which is about the concept of thermodynamic favorability and this time we're going to look at the numerical way to talk about that which is Delta G now that represents Gibbs free energy now Gibbs free energy Delta G is like I said earlier a measure of the thermodynamic favorability of a reaction and the way that we mathematically calculate Delta G is using this equation right here Delta g equals Delta H minus t * Delta s Now Delta G is what we call Gibs free energy and that's a measure of the thermodynamic favorability of a process if that Delta G is a negative number that means it is going to be thermodynamically favored however if the Delta G is a positive number then it's not going to be thermodynamically favored and the units that we use are kog per mole Now Delta H we've learned about that before in unit 6 and that's change in enthalpy that's also given to us in kilog per mole the T represents the temperature at which we're carrying out the process now if you ever see a little degree symbol as we sometimes see with these thermodynamic values that means that we're at standard conditions and temperature is 25° C or 298 Kelvin sometimes we have to use a different temperature though unless it uh specifies that Delta s is the change in entropy now you might remember from an earlier video that entropy is normally given in Jewels per mole per Kelvin well in order to make the math work out we have to have consistent units and so we're going to have to convert to kog per mole per Kelvin in order to make everything work out now we're going to do a couple examples with this here's the first one and this is a reaction that we've worked with a few times already in the last couple of videos it says to calculate Delta G for this reaction and notice that we're given Delta H and Delta s so once again we're going to plug and chug into this equation Delta gal Delta H minus t Delta s so Delta G is what we're solving for it says to calculate that and Delta H is given to us up here it's 131 kog per mole now for the T do you know what the temperature is the problem doesn't actually come straight out and tell us what that is but that little degree sign right there when especially up here when it says calculate Delta G that little degree sign tells us that we are at standard conditions which would be 25° C or 298 Kelvin Now Delta s is 134 Jew per mole per Kelvin but we have to convert it so that's going to be 134 K per mole per Kelvin so now we just do the math on this and if we multiply these two values together we get that we have 131 KJ per mole minus 39.9 K per mole and when you subtract that you find that the Delta G for this process is equal to positive 91 K per mole so what's the significance of that positive number well like I said earlier if it's positive that means that this is not a thermodynamically favored process at this particular temperature now let's do another problem a different example this is very typical it looks like the same equation but this time the question says at what what temperatures would this reaction be thermodynamically favored so once again we're going to use Delta gals Delta H minus t delt s and we have to remember that when we're determining at what temperature this reaction is going to change over to start being thermodynamically favored that means that the Delta G is going to stop being positive so it's going to go from posit positive to negative territory and the boundary between positive and negative is zero so I'm going to plug in a zero for my Delta G in order to determine the the threshold temperature at which we go from being not thermodynamically favored to thermodynamically favored so that's why I'm plugging in a zero here now Delta H we're we're going to assume that Delta H and Delta s don't change as temperature changes it's not completely true but it's it's almost true so we're going to just go ahead and plug in those numbers Delta H is 131 K per mole and then the T is for temperature we're solving for that threshold temperature so that's our unknown and Delta s once again we have to use uh consistent units so it's 134 K per mole per Kelvin and now I'm just solving for t so I'm going to bring the 131 to the other side of the equal sign and divide both sides by .34 and when I do that I find that the T equals 978 Kelvin so that's my threshold temperature so what this means is that since both Delta H and Delta s are positive we know this is going to be a relatively high temperature so that means at temperatures higher than 978 Kelvin so that's the answer if I can get this reaction above 978 Kelvin all of a sudden this reaction is going to be thermodynamically favored so that's how we can calculate Delta G using this equation Delta g equals Delta H minus t Delta s now there is another way to calculate Delta G for process and this is going to look familiar to you especially after we've done this a couple times already we can actually use the individual gibbs-free energies of the substances in the reaction Delta G for a reaction equals the sum of the Gibs free energies of the products minus the sum of the Gibs free energies of the reactants and once again if this looks familiar that's good because we did this back in unit 9 section two as well as all the way back in unit 6 it works the same way for Delta G as it does for Delta H and Delta s so if we have a copy of that thermodynamic data uh list we can consult that it's in the workbook or I will also put post it in the description below here's a reaction that we can use to solve for Delta G we have lead ions aquous plus two chloride ions aquous yields lead to Chloride solid so if we look at our table of thermodynamic data we notice that the Delta G for lead ions will be -4.4 K per mole well we only have one mole of that so there's really nothing to multiply by chloride has a Gibs free energy of 131.0 K per mole however we do have two moles of this as we see in the equation so we have to multiply this by two so that's why this is going to be - 262.50 k then on the lead 2 chloride we can consult the thermodynamic data and see that its Gibbs free energy is - 314.15927 and then of course there's only one product so there's nothing to add there and this is products minus reactants so that would be- 314.1c 3 K per mole we can see that yes since it's negative this would be thermodynamically favored at least at 25° Celsius which is our uh standard condition hope you learned something about Gibbs free energy and how to calculate it if you did go ahead and give me a thumbs up a like and I hope to see you in the next video where we're going to move on to unit 9 sections four and five thanks for

"Kinetic Control - ΔG and the Equilibrium Constant - AP Chem Unit 9, Topics 4-5","#apchem #apchemistry #thermodynamics   In this video, Mr. Krug discusses the concept of thermodynamic and kinetic control, in which some reactions take place so slowly their rate cannot be effectively measured.  Then, he shows how thermodynamics relates to the equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction, and how we can use the ΔG of a reaction to calculate its equilibrium constant, K.  00:00  Section 9.4

there I'm Jeremy kug and in this video we're going to take a look at some special types of thermodynamically favored processes in unit 9 section 4 as well as section five where we're going to learn about how equilibrium relates to thermodynamics well here in section four we're going to look at some reactions that take place so slowly that we can't even measure how uh fast they're going for example in fact this is one of my favorite examples of this is a car that's just rusting away so here we have a car that's been sitting in this desert for who knows how long and it's slowly rusting away now we know that this is a thermodynamically favored process and we know that because it's happening that car is obviously rusting there is no question that the reaction is taking place but it's happening so slowly that we can't really measure the rate in fact it might be happening over the course of years or even decades in this case reactions like that are said to be under kinetic control kinetic control and there are lots of reactions that are like that they uh are happening obviously they're happening very very slowly we can actually look at the uh Delta H values and the Delta s values for the reaction and we can see that yes this is a thermodynamically favored process so it should be taking place and we can probably see that it is just very slowly now what the reason for a reaction being like this well most of the time it's because a reaction has a very high activation energy now as you might remember from unit five a very high activation energy means that very few of those molecules that are trying to react are going to have the threshold uh energy in order to be able to produce an effective Collision so because of that there's a very high activation en energy it's going to be a very slow process and in this case it may take decades for this reaction to take place now just so we know this reaction has not stopped it it continues to to progress even though it is progressing very slowly as a result it is not at equilibrium so just be aware that there are some reactions that are like this we call those reactions that are under kinetic control now as we move on to section five we're going to talk about how we can relate equilibrium which we learned about in unit 7 to thermodynamics now we can actually use an equilibrium constant to tell whether or not a reaction is going to be thermodynamically favored at a certain temperature this is the equation that we use to make that calculation Delta g equals RT times the natural log of K now in this equation that that Delta Delta G is the Delta G that we've used in the last couple videos the change in Gibs free energy and once again just as a reminder if Delta G is a negative value it's a thermodynamically favored process if it's positive it is not now R is the universal gas constant since we're using units of jewels per mole per Kelvin the the numerical value for this is 8.314 Jew per mole per Kelvin T of course represents the temperature at which we're working in kelvin just remember if it's in Celsius you have to to convert it as you see here and then Ln K that represents the natural log of the equilibrium constant on your calculator you have an Ln button which will help you to do this so let's try an example here we have a chemical reaction that we've worked with many times in this course the production of ammonia and we have the equilibrium constant is18 at 500° C and the question says calculate the value of delta G for this reaction at 500° C well we're going to have to use that equation Delta g equals RT natural log of K so we're solving for Delta G the r is that universal gas constant 8.314 Je per mole per Kelvin now the temperature it's given to us as 500° C so in kelvin that's 773 Kelvin and then we have to take natural log of this equilibrium constant the natural log of18 according to my calculator is about 1715 so now I'm going to multiply these values by each other and I find that the delta Del g equals about postive 11,000 jewles per mole now we normally Express these thermodynamic values in kog don't we so we just move that decimal point over a few places and we have positive 11 KJ per mole so that's our answer for this one part B says is this reaction thermodynamically favored at 500° C and explain your answer well all we have to do is look at the sign of Delta G and since it is a positive value we'd have to say that no this is not thermodynamically favored since that Delta G is positive now to sum up when we think about how this equation works if we look at that that that equation we can see that numerically if Delta G ends up being a positive value that means that the equilibrium con constant must be a very small number that's just how that works numerically now in terms of the chemistry here what that means is if the reaction is not thermodynamically favored that's why that Delta G is positive right that means we're going to have very little products and that makes sense because if it's not thermodynamically favored you wouldn't expect for that reaction to to be very successful so you aren't going to have a lot product now the opposite would also have to be true if Delta G is a negative number whenever you do the calculation that means that K must be a very large number and that's just a numerical expression a numerical way of talking about this what that means for our chemistry here is that if Delta G is negative then we're talking about a thermodynamically favored process aren't we so when a process is thermodynamically favored we're going to have large amounts of product large value for K that's what that means a lot of product is formed and that makes sense because if a reaction is thermodynamically favored you would expect that reaction to be quite successful you'd have a lot of product now what if you have a Delta G value that is close to zero now probably won't be zero but it might be close to it well if that's the case then our equilibrium constant must be fairly close to one and as we learned in the equilibrium unit that means that you'll have approximately equal amounts of products and reactants I hope this video has helped you to learn about the concepts of kinetic control and how to use this equation Delta g equals RT natural log of K if you learned something go ahead and smash that like button my name is Jeremy Krug in our next video we're going to wrap up this concept of the second law of Thermodynamics and then we'll move on to to electrochemistry hope to

kug and in this video we're going to take a look at AP Chemistry unit 9 section six which is about how we can manipulate chemical reactions and what effect that has on its thermodynamic favorability so if you haven't subscribed yet go ahead and subscribe that way you'll have access to all my review videos and AP daily lessons as well well we've talked about thermodynamically favored processes in the last couple of videos and we said that if it's thermodynamically favored that means it's a process that generally speaking is going to happen at a certain temperature now mathematically that means it's Delta G its change in Gibs free energy is less than zero so it's a negative number so just as an example there are some processes that you don't even need to have data for you can probably figure it out if it's a thermodynamically favored process or not for example on the the screen here we see the melting of ice on a hot summer day I think you'll agree that that is going to happen that is a thermodynamically favored process now how about if we have water maybe water in a cup or in a glass is it going to decompos into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas at 20° C well generally speaking that doesn't happen you can have water and it's it's not going to decompose at that room temperature so that's not not a thermodynamically favored process what about this let's say that we take a a very superheated piece of iron up to 1500° C and we drop that into liquid water is that liquid water going to get hotter most definitely isn't it so that also is a thermodynamically favored process what about this though if we have a broken egg maybe it's on the floor someone has dropped it is that broken egg going to rearrange itself into to a round unbroken egg just on its own well it's not is is it that's kind of ridiculous even to think about that so that is not a thermodynamically favored process if we had to assign a Delta G for that itself it would certainly be a positive number well as it turns out if a process is thermodynamically favored in One Direction that it has to be a non thermodynamically favor process in the reverse reaction so what that means is let's take this this first example here we all were in agreement that that is a thermodynamically favored process well what about the reverse of that liquid water freezing on a hot summer day well that's not thermodynamically favored is it if it's a thermodynamically favored in One Direction it's not in the opposite so we can take the second example as as well what about if hydrogen gas and oxygen gas are reacted into water at 20° C and yes that is a thermodynamically favored process all we need for that is is a very small spark and we have a reaction so it doesn't have a very high activation energy at all in this third example what about this what about liquid water gets colder when a superheated piece of iron is added No in fact sounds ridiculous doesn't it so that is not a thermodynamically favored process and then in this last example what about we drop an egg and it cracks and breaks well yeah that's going to happen isn't it that's a thermodynamically favored process so once again if it's favored in One Direction it is not favored in the opposite direction now we're going to uh take this concept and we're going to take it a step further in something called thermodynamic coupling now sometimes there are chemical processes that we would really like to happen that to be honest just do not happen this is a lot like hessa's law that we learned in unit six but we can't call it hess's law because it's not change in enthalpy this is Delta G this is called thermodynamic coupling so if we have this process right here if you have copper uh one sulfide it would be really nice if you could take that copper one sulfide and just decompose it and get copper out of that you know copper is used for all kinds of industrial purposes wiring all kinds of things it's a great conductor but unfortunately if you have a compound an ore or something that is copper sulfide containing copper one sulfide and you trust I just try to heat it up and get copper and sulfur out of that it's not going to happen very easily in fact notice its Delta G is a positive value it is not a thermodynamically favored process so what do we do well we don't just throw our hands up and give up there is another reaction that we can couple that with that will actually make this process possible so what if we have this if we take a look at sulfur plus oxygen gas it provides us with sulfur dioxide gas and that reaction in itself has a Delta G that is very negative so that is a thermodynamically favored process so here's the deal if we take these two reactions and we add them together so if we add the two reactions together we can cancel out the sulfurs right there and when you add them together we get copper one sulfide solid plus oxygen gas yields two moles of copper and a mole of sulfur dioxide and to find the Delta G of that new reaction well since we added the individual reactions together we have to add those Delta G's together as well and we find that the Delta G of this process is very much thermodynamically favored it's - 214.2 KES per mole so if you remember doing hessa's law back in unit 6 this is the same thing uh all you have to do is add the reactions and add those Delta G values together if you learned something from this video please slam that like button and I hope to see you in the next video where we're going to move on to the next part of unit 9 which is all about

Summary",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl5mJT0tvSE&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=97,hi there I'm Jeremy kug and in this video we're going to take a look at AP Chemistry unit 9 section 7 which is an introduction to electrochemistry if you haven't already subscribed go ahead and consider doing that and if you learn something from my video go ahead and slam that like button I would really appreciate it that really does help the algorithm well as we take a look at electrochemistry electrochemistry is just the practical application of redo reactions now way back in un four we talked about redo this is basically just where one species is gaining electrons another one is losing electrons let's take a look at an example here let's say we have a piece of iron that is added to a solution of copper to sulfate well first thing we have to do is recognize that the sulfate ion is not doing anything that's a spectator ion because in most of these Redux reactions a metal is reac acting with metal ions so it's the iron and the copper 2 ions that are the reactants now what are the products going to be well the metals normally get oxidized don't they into metallic ions so iron is going to become iron 2+ and the metallic ions normally get reduced down into a metal so the copper 2+ is going to become copper metal now we have to balance these we see that there's a charge of zero on the left on this first half reaction and a plus two over here so to balance this out we need two electrons on the right side and then likewise to balance out the charge on the second half reaction we need two electrons on the left side right there so now we can take these two half reactions and add them together we realize that the first one is oxidation because we are losing electrons and the second one is reduction because we're gaining electrons you might remember from unit 4 we said Leo the Lion goes g right lose electrons oxidation and then that g gerer gain electrons is reduction or if you prefer if that's not sophisticated enough then you can think of oil rig oil oxidation is losing rig rig reduction is gaining so now we can take these two half reactions and add them together and you get the overall balanced Redux reaction so we have iron solid and copper 2 aquous ions yield iron 2 ions aquous and copper metal solid now let's imagine what this might look like on a microscopic or a submicroscopic scale let's imagine that we have a piece of iron metal there's our iron solid it's in this nice electrode or piece of iron of some type and then we have copper ions those are in aquous solution that means that they're swimming around in water and every one of these iron atoms would be a little bit more stable if it could lose a couple of electrons and likewise the copper 2 ions those are are fairly stable but as it turns out iron is more active which means iron would be a lot better at giving its electrons away than iron wood so what's going to happen well basically something like this and so essentially you can see that some of these metals and metal ions have essentially swapped places in the electrode in the solution for example these copper atoms here they used to be in solution they were swimming around weren't they well what happens is this this metal has just stolen electrons from Iron and so because of that it's now imprisoned in the solid state and so it is locked up as part of that solid electrode right there and likewise the iron metal just gave its electrons back so it gets to be free and swimming around in the aquous state and so as you can see the copper and the iron basically just swapped uh states there now these forces the tendency of these particles to to transfer the electrons is very great in fact it is so great that we can actually harness this force and push those electrons through a wire and so here I have the same reaction except I've set it up in two electrodes where on one side we have iron on the other side we have the copper and one half reaction is taking place over here on the left side and one of the half reactions is taking place on the other side so what I mean is We have basically created a battery and in chemistry we call this a galvanic cell but that's basically just a battery We have basically uh harnessed these these half reactions here and what happens is these electrons when they are transferred they're actually transferred through this wire right here and so we can pass this wire through something like a light bulb or a cell c phone or a voltmeter or something like that a radio you know something like that flashlight and we can actually harness that electricity we can power some sort of a load so what's happening well let's take a closer look at this galvanic cell now on the left side where this iron is that's where the iron half reaction is taking place the iron is turning into iron two plus ions and two electrons that's the same half reaction that we just wrote a minute ago now on the other side where the copper electrode is located that's where the copper half reaction is taking place the copper 2+ gains the two electrons making it into copper so what we have here is basically two half reactions now this half reaction in fact every half reaction has a voltage associated with it so for example this iron half reaction has a voltage of plus 0.44 volts and this half reaction the copper being reduced has a voltage of positive. 34 volts so if you want to know the total overall voltage of the battery we just have to add these two together and so the total cell potential or the total voltage that's going through the wire here is 78 volts now if you had some sort of a voltmeter you could plug this and it would actually show up like this on the actual digital readout so 78 volts and that's a voltage that you can use to you know to to run some sort of a load like a light bulb or a radio or something like that a calculator maybe and so yes we have a potential difference of 78 volts now I want you to notice that over here we have oxidation we have the metal being oxidized into metal ions on the other side here where the copper is located we have reduction the copper ions are being reduced down into copper metal now in chemistry when we have a galvanic cell we give these a name this electrode over here where the oxidation is taking place is called the anode that's just what it's called there that is just a a name for that oxidation takes place at the anode and likewise over here this electrode where reduction is taking place is called the cathode and once again that's just the name of it reduction takes place at the cathode and you have to know that and there are perhaps some uh pneumonic AIDs that people use uh a very common one that I show my students is you can think of a red cat and an ox and so if you think of a red cat and an ox you'll realize that reduction takes place at the cathode and the anode is where oxidation takes place so uh that is a nice little Nifty pneumonic Aid if you want something that's a little bit more sophisticated you might think that the words oxidation and anode both start with vowels and reduction and cathode both start with consonants so you you can do that too it kind of works the same way now when we think about the actual electricity that's moving Through the Wire the electrons are always going to move from the anode to the cathode Through the Wire so this this is the anode this this iron electrode so that means that they're moving from the anode to the cathode which is the copper side so going to draw that in here that is the movement of electrons Through the Wire if you forget that then think of the AC or the air conditioning goes from anode to cathode that's how electrons move now as you were to watch if you were to watch this this battery or this galvanic cell run what would you see well if you look at the overall balanced equation or even just these two half reactions you'll see that the iron is going to be essentially uh dissolving or or or corroding if you want to say that into iron 2 ions and so as time goes on this iron is going to be slowly eaten away actually the solid iron U anode is going to lose weight over here on the other hand the cathode is going to gain weight because we are producing copper as a product so we would expect to see whoops we would expect to see this copper start to get larger so you can imagine like a mass of copper being deposited out and so the copper the cathode increases in Mass if it's a solid cathode whereas the solid anode is going to decrease in mass or if you want aonic aid for that the cat gets fat or in other words the cathode gains weight it gets fat if you want to say that so let's focus on this salt bridge so you might notice that we have this salt bridge here that we haven't said anything about the salt bridge is necessary for this galvanic cell to run if you don't put the salt bridge in there you're not going to have a voltage you're not going to have a circuit now why is the salt bridge there well it's not really there to complete the circuit that's not really what's happening here the salt bridge is allowing a transfer of ions it's allowing a transfer of ions and so if we look at what we have back here notice that the iron is turning into iron 2+ and so we are producing iron 2+ ions into this solution well you can't just produce cat ions and just not have anything else to go along with it because then this side gets very positive and it you end you end up getting electrocuted I suppose or the same thing over here this side gets U the opposite you know if this side gets more positive this side would get more a negative so in order to balance that out the salt bridge helps keep the charges all balanced and so what happens is we put some sort of inert uh salt or ionic compound in that salt bridge with some sort of a gel probably and the anion notice what happens there that anion is going to grab itate toward the anode that kind of makes sense though anion travel toward the anode and notice what happens to this sodium ion here which is a Caton it does this the cat ions are going to travel toward the cathode that makes sense too doesn't it cat ions go toward the cathode through the salt bridge now like I said the ions in that salt bridge should be inert that means they they are things that are not going to react with the other ions in these two beakers or Solutions over here if you don't do that you're going to have some sort of a precipitate or some sort of a Gunk that's formed in one or both of your beakers I've seen that happen and it messes up your results and so you don't want to do that so let's just summarize what we have about galvanic cells here before we move on to the next part of this reduction takes place at the cathode oxidation takes takes place at the anode or if you want a nice pneumonic Aid Red Cat and an ox electrons travel through the wire from the anode to the cathode think about the AC the cathode increases in Mass the cat gets fat from the salt bridge anion travel toward the anode and Cat ions travel toward the cathode and one last little detail here that I want to show with you galvanic cells are always thermodynamically favored that means if you have a battery and you stick it into a flashlight or a a radio or something it should just work you shouldn't have to do something to the battery to make it to work it should it it should work just uh pretty much spontaneously well in our next video we're going to learn how we get these voltage values and how we can calculate the potential difference in a galvanic cell I hope to see you then,"5,497",0,97

easy IL oxidized that metal is so in this example we can compare silver and zinc and we see that zinc is much higher on the activity series than silver is so that tells us that zinc is going to be oxidized into zinc ions and that means that the silver ions are going to have to be reduced into into silver metal now I guess we should mention that that activity series is not just some arbitrary listing that somebody invented it actually comes from somewhere and this comes from a list of what's called standard reduction potentials and so every half reaction that we could ever possibly have has a voltage or a potential associated with it now I want you to notice that in the activity series that I showed you earlier that was a list of what's more easily oxidized well this list is the opposite its reduction potentials and notice in the last uh example there I had silver and zinc well notice that the silver ions being reduced into silver metal has a much higher reduction potential than the other possibility which I believe was Zinc ions being reduced into zinc metal so since that's the case the one that has the more positive reduction potential that's the one that actually is going to be the reduction that takes place and the other one is actually going to end up being an oxidation now we know that in every redo reaction every G nxl we're going to have one reduction and we're going to have one oxidation something has to be the cathode something has to be the anode however every textbook every listing that I've ever seen all always gives these half reaction potential differences as reduction half reactions and they're always written as reduction and so in order to account for that when we calculate the overall potential difference of the cell which we're going to call E cell we have to take the potential of the cathode that's given to us on the chart and we're going to subtract the potential of the anode and by doing that we're going to be able to get the overall e cell so let's take a look at this example it says use these half reactions to determine which one is the anode which one is the cathode and the overall cell potential so we're going to plug these numbers into the equation now the thing is we're going to plug them in in two different ways with the 34 in that first position and then in the other possibility with the .44 in the first position and we're looking for the answer that gives us a positive number in every galvanic cell the E cell has to be positive and so which one of these subtractions is going to give us a positive number that's what we have to ask ourselves well you can see it's the first one this one right here is going to give us a positive voltage for that galvanic cell so what that means is the cathode is always in the first position so that means that the copper has to be the cathode because it was placed in that first position and then the iron has to be placed in the second position that's the anode so that tells us that copper was the cathode iron was the anode and that is something that we can tell because this subtraction gives us the positive voltage now what is the overall cell potential well it's whatever the answer to this is so 34 volts plus44 volts gets us 78 volts so that's how we can determine which one's going to be the anode which one's going to be the cathode based on the half reaction cell potentials now we just calculated e cell the overall potential difference or the voltage for this galbanic cell I want you to notice that there is a little degree sign here and as we've said many times in the past in this course already that little degree sign mentions or implies that we are at standard conditions now what does that mean that means that our galvanic cell is operating at a temperature of 25° C all your Solutions are at 1 mole per liter if there are any gases present they would be at 1 atmosphere and later on we'll talk about how that may not always be the case and how that changes your e cell let's try another example we're going to use these two half reactions to determine which one is the anode which one is the cathode the overall cell potential eel and the overall balanced equation for the process so once again we're going to plug into this subtraction and we're going to do it both ways we're going to subtract this number minus that number and then we'll subtract this number minus that number we have to see which one gets us the positive number so which one gets us the positive value well it looks like it's this one over here isn't it that one will work that one will not so that means whichever uh value is in the first location the first position that's the cathode so the .14 the 10 is the cathode the one in the second position is the anode so that would be the aluminum is the anod so we've determined that now the overall cell potential is just the numerical value of this calculation so .14 volts plus 1.66 Vols gets us positive 1.52 Vols the E cell for a galvanic cell has to be positive if it's negative you've done something wrong if if it's a galvanic cell now what's the overall balanced equation well the way this works is you write the cathodes half reaction as it stands so it's going to be 10 2+ plus two electrons you it's 10 just like it's written the anode is the one you have to flip and if you need help remembering that just remember that anode is like anti and so that means we have to flip the reaction action and that's also reflected in the equation because it's a negative we have to subtract that number so that's the one that we flip so notice that it's written you know al3+ plus 3 electrons yields aluminum well when we write the overall balanced equation we have to reverse it so that we'll have the overall equation so it looks like this now when we add these two together uh notice that the electrons do not uh cancel out as they stand so we have to multiply equation number one by three and equation number two has to be multiplied by two so now we have six electrons that will fall out they'll disappear when you add these together and so now we have the overall balanced equation for this galvanic cell so that's how you do an example like this let's try one that's a bit more uh Advanced it says a galvanic cell is composed using nickel and an unknown metal at standard conditions when the cell is first connected its potential difference is read to be 2.12 volts it is observed that the nickel electrode increases in mass as the reaction proceeds and we have a half reaction here identify the anode and the cathode determine the identity of the unknown metal electrode write the overall balanced equation for the galvanic cell and predict the sign of Delta G for this galvanic cell well for part A identify the anode and the cathode there's a little negative information that the question gives us that we need to use in order to answer that it says it is observed that the nickel electrode proceedes that's the giveaway because remember it's the cathode the metal cathode that is going to increase in Mass so that means means that nickel has to be the cathode like we said in the last video the cat gets fat right that's a little pneumonic Aid that might help us to remember that the cathode increases in Mass so that means the other metal which we don't know what it is yet that one has to be the anode now for Part B determine the identity of of the unknown metal electrode well I'm going to plug into this equation right here e cell equals e cathode minus E anode now we know two of these three numbers already we know that the overall potential difference is 2.12 volts that's what it tells us in the problem so 2.12 goes in for eel we know that nickel is the cathode and its uh value is .25 volts so that goes in there for E cathode and then we're solving for E anode so we just have a simple algebra problem here and when we calculate this we find that the potential of the anode is - 2.37 volts so now all we have to do is take that negative 2.37 volts and match that up on the list of standard reduction potentials and see which element that is and if you do that we have that in the on the previous uh slide there or you can look it up on your copy if you've downloaded one from the the description below and you'll find that it is magnesium so we know that the anode is magnesium now the overall balanced equation well the cathode half reaction is written as it's given to us so it's going to look like this and so the Magnesium is the anode so it is being oxidized so the Magnesium is turning into magnesium 2+ ions and two electrons so now all we have to do is add these together and it's kind of nice that these two electrons will disappear whenever we add them together so our overall balanced equation looks like this nickel 2+ aquous plus magnesium solid yields nickel solid plus magnesium 2 plus aquous now Part D predict the sign of Delta G for this galvanic cell well this is a galvanic cell it's always going to be thermodynamically favored all galvanic cells are thermodynamically favored so the Delta G has to be a negative value it's less than zero let's take a look at one more advanced type of question that sometimes is given to us um sometimes we are given a picture like this which has several materials and we're told build a galvanic cell that has the highest possible potential difference the highest possible e cell so what do you do well we have to have the standard reduction potentials given to us in order to do that so here they are and can you use that information to figure out which one is going to have the highest e cell which combination of these three Metals well we have to choose two so what I do in my mind is I take these these three values these three numerical values and I actually either physically or mentally plot them on a number line so for example the nickel half reaction has a half reaction potential of .23 volt so that falls right around here on my number line and the copper ion being reduced is positive. 34 volt so that's going to fall over here and then the aluminum is- 1.66 volt so that falls way back over here and remember we're trying to find the the two metals here that are going to create the greatest potential difference now literally what that means is we actually have to find the two metals here that have the greatest difference in their potentials that's literally what that means so which of these two metals would have the greatest difference between them they're the farthest apart aluminum and copper so that's the combination you want to choose if you're looking for the greatest potential difference now what if the question said what's the smallest potential difference well in that case it would be nickel and copper wouldn't it but here we're looking for the greatest difference in those two potentials the greatest potential difference so now we have decided it's going to be copper and aluminum and so now we just have to calculate the cell potential so we're going to plug into the equation E cell equals e cathode minus E anode and if you look at these two values you can see that the way this is going to give us a a positive value for the eell is to have copper in the cathode location and to have aluminum in the anode position so when you calculate this you'll find that 34 volts plus 1.66 volts gets us a total eell of about 2.0 volts so that's the potential of this galvanic cell now the last thing we have to do is to write the cell equation so once again the cathode which is the copper is going to stay as is the anode that's the anti that's the one that you have to flip around so we're going to write this as aluminum yields aluminum 3+ plus three electrons whenever we add these together we notice that the electrons do not disappear whenever you add the these together so equation number one has to be multiplied by three like this and equation number two has to be multiplied by two like this and now the six electrons will cancel out whenever we add these together and we get an overall balanced equation that looks like this so we've had a few Advanced examples here I hope you've learned something from this video about Galan ex cels and the calculations that we have to do sometimes involving those if you learned something please hit that like button I hope to see you in the next video where we're going to move right on to unit 9 Section 8 hope to see you then,"4,445",0,98

in this video we're going to take a look at AP Chemistry unit 9 Section 8 which is all about the thermodynamic favorability of electrochemical cells now in the last couple videos we've been learning about how to calculate e cell the potential difference for a galvanic cell and in this video we're going to talk about how to calculate or determine the thermodynamic favorability of those cells now here's the equation that we're going to use for that Delta g equals in Fe as we've already learned here in unit 9 we know that Delta G is the quantitative measurement of how thermodynamically favored a process is if it's thermodynamically favored that Delta G is going to have to be a negative number if for some reason it's not thermodynamically favored Delta G will be a positive number now the N this is the number of electrons that are transferred you might remember that whenever we wrote these uh balanced equations in the last couple of videos we had to flip around one of those uh half reactions and add the two half reactions together and however many electrons disappeared or were canceled out on the left side in the right side that's the number that's going to go in there for n your most common numbers will be one two and six in these equations it could be something different but those are your most likely uh numbers that could go in there for n now f is a constant this is called Faraday constant and we're going to use that in several of the next uh couple of of lessons here Faraday's constant is equal to 96,4 185 kums per mole of electrons now this is a number that's given to you on the AP exam uh and so it'll be given to you but it is it is nice to know that now e of course refers to the E cell that's the potential difference or the voltage of the electrochemical cell now just as a reminder you might remember that almost all of our eell values have been positive and that's the case for a galvanic cell all of the electrochemical cells that we've worked with so far in this unit in these videos have been galvanic cells and just by convention that e cell that potential difference has to be positive and if that's the case the process is thermodynamically favored now there are some electrochemical cells that could have a negative value for E cell if that's the case the process is not thermodynamically favored now that doesn't mean that the process could never take place in fact there is a special type of electrochemical cell that is specifically for that and that's what we call an electrolytic cell or in other words it's a process of electrolysis where we have to connect an external power source in order to make the reaction proceed so we are going to take a look at that in a couple of videos here coming up so let's go ahead and take a look at this example problem it says a galvanic cell is connected using nickel and aluminum Metals at standard conditions let's calculate the overall e cell the cell potential and Delta G for this galvanic cell so once again just like we did in the last video we have to subtract these two values in the two possible configurations and so let's do this one and then we'll do the other direction and the question that we have to ask ourselves since this is a galvanic cell e cell has to be positive so which of those two uh combinations is going to give us the positive value well it's this one over here isn't it that one gives us a negative value so that's not going to work so whenever you look at this if the question asked us to go one step further and say which one is the cathode and which one is the anode we know that the cathode is always in the first position so that would be nickel is our cathode here and then the anode would be in the second position so that's aluminum so the E cell is just whatever you compute this to be so that's positive 1.41 volts and now we're going to go ahead and calculate Delta G for this process using that equation right there so we're solving for Delta G do you see what the N is going to be here whenever you uh flip around that aluminum half reaction and add these together what would the number of electrons have to be in order for this to work well I think you've done enough of these now to realize that two and three won't add up you have to get a total of six right so our n on this one is going to be six F Faraday constant is that 96,000 485 K per mole of electrons and our e is our voltage that we just calculated 1.41 volts I'm going to write this in here uh 1.41 jewles per Kum just so you know one volt is equal to one Jewel per Kum I'm doing that so you can see how the units work out here so we know that the kums would cancel and the electrons would cancel as well so the units whenever you multiply these numbers together are going to be Jews per mole so that would be negative 86,000 jewles per mole now we normally write these in kog per mole so that's 816 kilo per mole so once again is this a thermodynamically favored process well it most certainly is as you can see hope you've learned something about eell and Delta G and how they are related to each other uh if you learned something please slam that like button I hope to see you in the next video where we're going to move right on and talk about what happens when we're not at standard conditions hope to see you then","3,957",0,99

we're going to take a look at AP Chemistry unit 9 section 9 which is all about galvanic cells that are operating at non standard conditions now you might remember in the last several videos we've been calculating the eell the potential difference or the voltage of different galvanic cells and in pretty much every case we've made the assumption that we're at standard conditions which is 25° C one mole per liter in the case of solutions and if there are any gases would be one atmosphere well that's a big assumption because as you probably know in the real world we're not always working under those ideal laboratory conditions so let's imagine we have this equation here and this represents a galvanic cell what's going to happen as the galvanic cell reaction progresses well let's imagine that we start at standard conditions what is the initial concentration and temperature of all solutions when the galvanic cell begins to run well like I said it's at standard conditions so it would be 25° C and concentration would be 1 mole per liter now what's going to happen to the concentration of copper ions and aluminum ions as the reaction continues to run well let's think about this copper 2 ions would be a reactant and I think it makes sense that a reactant is going to be depleted as the reaction continues so we would say that the copper ion concentration should go down as the reaction goes on and aluminum ions are a product in this reaction so it would stand to reason that as the reaction continues you would expect the aluminum ion concentration to increase since it's a product and that's exactly what happens your reactants are going to decrease inre your aluminum ions are going to increase now what happens to the potential difference of the cell as the reaction continues to run well if you think about electricity as a product you know that as the reaction continues the voltage is going to go down isn't it so the potential difference is going to decrease eventually you're going to get less and less and less electricity as the reaction goes on I think that makes sense because if you have a a cell phone for example you charge it up in the morning and it has a 100% battery level if as you use that cell phone it it it its percentage value goes down it goes down to 90% 80% 70% the potential difference you would expect to go down now if your cell phone just somehow magically went up you know said 70% 80% 90% 100% on its own you'd think something was up right that's not what you expect your voltage goes down as you run the battery now what happens to the galvanic cell when it attains equilibrium well this is when the battery is dead and so at that at that point the voltage of your galvanic cell equals 0 volts so if you have a battery at equilibrium it's dead don't buy those batteries if they are at equilibrium because well they're dead they have a voltage of zero now let's take a look at this example this looks like pretty much the same equation the galvanic cell represented by the equation below begins at standard conditions calculate the concentration of copper 2+ ions when aluminum ion concentration has increased to 1.50 moles per liter now for something like this I would would strongly recommend that you use an ice box I think this helps us to keep our our concentration straight pretty well I know it's been a few lessons since we've used an ice box this represents initial concentration change in concentration and equilibrium concentration now since we're starting at standard conditions our Solutions are both going to be one mole per liter so I'm going to fill those in notice that the solids are basically irrelevant because they don't really have a concentration because they're they're solids or at least they're not going to be relevant in the reaction so it says that the aluminum has increased to 1.50 molar so down here at equilibrium or or end I should say it's not really equilibrium it's going to be 1.50 molar so can we calculate the change between initial and end well it's a gain of 050 molar isn't it so if this side is gaining 0.5 well this side has to go down doesn't it and by how much well it's a 3:2 ratio so it's going to go down by three Hales as much as this went up so that's 75 isn't it so that means this side is going to go down by 75 that means our ending concentration is going to be2 5 moles per liter and that's the answer it's 0.25 mol and you can answer questions like this not just for um for ganic cells but pretty much for any reaction that involves stochiometry and change in concentrations of solutions that works out pretty well to use an ice box now we've talked about nonstandard uh conditions we're going to take a look at another equation here that actually would help us to calculate the voltage at something or at conditions that are not standard here e that's just the the voltage or the cell potential at whatever conditions that you're talking about e with that degree sign represents the voltage that you calculate at standard conditions those are like the voltages that we calculated in these last couple of videos and then we have this other term RT over NF time natural log of Q now Q is the reaction quotient that is the the products over reactants raised to the power of the coefficients at some non-equilibrium value now there are a couple things that we can point out about this equation first of all it would be very unusual for the College Board to ask you to actually use the nnest equation to solve for something in here this is not something that they generally have students do on the AP exam it is is rather time consuming and uh the benefit is is is not that great so they're probably not going to have you just plug and chug in this equation one thing that they will have you do though is think about how these variables can be manipulated now notice that a couple of things in this equation really cannot be changed R and F are constants R is that universal gas constant of 8.314 Jew per mole per Kelvin that's never going to change and F is feraday constant 9648 KS per mole of electrons that's never going to change either and to be honest if you're looking at a specific chemical reaction the number of electrons will not change either that's pretty much fixed based upon the equation so RN and f aren't going to change now T could change couldn't it so temperature could go up well notice that if we think about t if the temperature goes up that's going to cause this entire term to go up in value and since that's a subtracted term that means that your voltage or your potential difference is going to go down so essentially what we're saying here is if you raise the temperature of a galvanic cell its voltage goes down now I'm not sure about you but I remember years ago my grandparents would put batteries into the refrigerator because they said it made them last longer now maybe it has something to do with this uh did my grandparents know about the nurst equation probably not but maybe they were told at some point that you know lowering the temperature of your batteries putting them in the fridge will help them to last longer you know maybe that's what they were thinking about likewise if you lower the temperature you know your your e is going to increase now most of the time we're not really changing the temperature what we're changing would be the the the concentrations of the substances those values that go into Q now let's think about Q if you increase the concentration of the products well products are written on the numerator of Q right so that's going to make Q increase and that means this whole term increases and your volt volage or your cell potential is going to go down so increasing the products causes the voltage to go down now what else is going to do that well not just increasing products but decreasing reactants and so notice decreasing reactants increasing products have the same net effect on your voltage it causes that cell potential to go down now let's think about the other way around what what happens if we increase the reactants well reactants are written in the denominator of Q aren't they so if we increase the denominator of Q that's going to cause the value of Q to go down it's going to cause Q to decrease and that's going to cause this entire term to decrease which means your voltage or your cell potential is going to go up so think about that increasing reactants what else would have that effect well decreasing the products so if you increase the reactants or you decrease the product concentration it's going to cause your voltage or your cell potential to go up so you don't really have to know how to plug and chug into this equation although it would be nice I suppose the fact is know how these different manipulations of temperature and reactants and products will change the value of e now let's apply this let's go back to that same reac reaction that we looked at earlier let's answer this question how is the potential difference of the cell affected when the concentration of the copper ion is increased well let's think about that we know that increasing the the copper ion concentration well that's written in the denominator of Q isn't it so that's going to cause that Q to decrease and that's going to cause the E cell to increase so we can think about it that way let's go the other direction how is the potential difference of the cell affected when the concentration of aluminum is increased well aluminum is a product products are written in the numerator of Q aren't they so if they're written in the numerator that means that this change is going to cause the value of Q to go up and that's a subtracted term so it's going to cause eel C to go down so e cell is going to decrease state two ways to increase the potential difference of this galvanic cell well we've already talked about one we can increase the concentration of copper ions what's the other one we can decrease the concentration of the aluminum ions that has the same net effect on your e cell now once again the AP exam is going to give you the nerst equation so you can look at that and and see how changing those those values would manipulate the value of your cell potential so don't feel like you have to go out and memorize the nerst equation you certainly don't have to do that I hope you've learned something from this video about non-standard conditions in galvanic cells if you have go ahead and consider uh hitting that

"Electrolysis and Faraday's Law Practice Problems - AP Chem Unit 9, Topic 10","#apchem #apchemistry #electrolysis #electrolyticcell #faradayslaw   In this video, Mr. Krug shows students how to use Faraday's Law to calculate the amount of an element that can be electroplated during an electrolysis reaction.

Next?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51kjxyY8UTg&list=PLp8P489qkBoZb_b4_FOgGGPWGxrVV6Al9&index=101,"hi there I'm Jeremy kug and this is unit 9 section 10 of AP Chemistry the last section we're going to be learning about electrolysis in this video now electrolysis is a process by which you can take a solution that contains ions and connect a power source with two electrodes there and dip these electrodes into aquous Solutions of those ions and it'll power some some half reactions usually if we have a solution like this maybe this is a nickel 2 chloride as you can see here and we pass a current of electricity through that solution most likely our goal is to Plate out some of that nickel onto an electrode and we can use that for commercial purposes perhaps for a nickel plating or or some other sort of of application so this is the stochiometry of electrochemistry this is often uh how we are trying to to calculate how much of that the nickel or what other metal like gold or silver you might be able to Plate out onto an electrode and so whenever we talk about the sto geometry of electrochemistry this is the equation that we're probably going to be using now I is going to represent the current that is from physics uh and current is measured in ampi sometimes we just abbreviate that amps that's the same thing now now Q represents the actual quantity of electric charge the actual flow of how many electrons have flowed into uh the reaction this is measured in kums so Q is going to be kums now T stands for time and that's how much time has elapsed over the course of the reaction and that's going to be measured in seconds so current equals electric charge over time in seconds we're going to do several examples here so you can see how this works here's our first example a current of 2.50 amp is passed through a wire for 3 minutes what is the quantity of electric charge that passes through the wire so once again we're going to use that equation i = q overt now it tells us what the current is the current is 2.50 amps so that's going to get plugged in for the I and then Q is what we're solving for it says what is the quantity of electric charge so Q is going to be our unknown and T is the time now it says 3.00 minutes well don't write three down there because remember time has to be in seconds and so we have to convert that to seconds 3 * 60 is 180 seconds so now all we have to to do to find the quantity of electric charge the Q is to multiply 2.5 * 180 and we get that the answer is 450 Kum so that's the answer 450 kums now let's go one step further let's determine how many moles of electrons have passed through the wire so we're going to take 450 kums and we're going to convert that to moles of electrons but how do we do that well there is a constant that we learned a couple of videos ago called the Faraday constant and it says that there are 9648 kums in one mole of electrons so we can actually use that as a conversion factor so I'm putting KS on the bottom here since that's what we're trying to cancel out and the question is moles of electrons so moles of electrons go on top and like I said Faraday's constant is one mole of electrons equal 9648 K so we can cancel KS and just divide 450 by 9648 and we find that it's 4.66 * 10 -3 moles of electrons that are passing through the wire so that's how you can solve this let's take a look at another example here this one says a 10 amp current is passed through a solution of nickel 2 chloride for 1 hour what mass of nickel metal can be plated out well once again we're going to first of all calculate the amount of electric charge just like we did in that last problem because we're given the current we're given the time so we can figure out the electric charge pretty easily using the equation i = q overt so we're going to plug and chug into that I is for the current and it says that the current is 10.0 Z amps so I'm going to plug that in for I now Q is the electric charge that's what we're trying to solve for so that's my unknown and the T is for time time has to be in seconds do you know how many seconds are in one hour well 60 seconds * 60 minutes that's 3,600 seconds so that's going to be our value for T so now we just have to multiply these numbers by each other and we find that the electric charge is 36,000 Kum so that's the answer to the first part of that now notice that's not what the question's asking for the question's asking what massive nickel metal can be plated out and that's not the answer is it so we're going to have to go a step further and convert from KS to grams of nickel using stochiometry now how do we do that well first of all we know that in order to do a sto geometry problem we have to have a balanced equation don't we and we don't have a balanced equation yet well we need to write that we're starting with nickel 2 ions and those nickel 2 ions are being turned into nickel metal so the balanced half reaction for that process looks like this nickel 2+ plus two electrons yields nickel make sure that you're able to write something like that from looking at at the problem nickel 2 is being produced or being turned into nickel products so there's our balanced half reaction so now we can do our sto geometry I'm starting with 36,000 kums so I'm going to start that uh as our first number here and the question is mass of nickel so grams of nickel will be down here at the end now in every reaction stochiometry that we've done in this course you might remember that the first step is convert to moles isn't it so moles well moles of what because we have KS well KS is a quantity of charge isn't it that's electrons so let's convert to moles of electrons and we do that using Faraday constant so kums have to go on the bottom here so it'll cancel out and moles of electrons go on top and Faraday's constant tells us that one mole of electrons is equivalent to 96,4 185 K so I can put that into the conversion factor Ks are going to cancel top and bottom I'm now in moles of electrons so that's step one step two is the mole ratio so in our mole ratio we see that we need to put electrons on the bottom so that electrons will cancel out and I'm trying to convert to Nickel so that means that nickel needs to go on the top and to get the numbers for this I'm I'm going to use the coefficients of my balanced equation and the equation says that there's one nickel produced for every two electrons just us as coefficients so it's one nickel for every two electrons so now I can cancel out electrons top and bottom I'm in moles of nickel but I want to be in grams of nickel so that means I have to do step three which is convert to final unit so in this last step I'm going to have to put moles on the bottom and grams on top because I'm converting to grams and I can consult the periodic table for nickel and I find that its molar mass is about 58.69 G in one mole that's just the atomic mass of nickel of course so now I can cancel moles top and bottom and in my calculator I'm going to take 36,000 divide by 96,4 185 divide by 2times 58.69 and when I key that into my calculator I find that I'm going to produce 10.95 G of nickel so that's how you do it so we got to calculate the charge and then figure out the grams of nickel using that stochiometry process those same three steps that we learned way back in the earlier part of this course convert to moles mole ratio then convert to that final unit let's do one more problem here this one says with a 30 amp current how long will it take to plate out 50 g of aluminum from a solution of aluminum chloride well what do we do here we have the amps we're being asked to calculate time the problem doesn't really tell us how many kums we have but we can figure that out can't we so this time our first step needs to be to determine the number of kums so we're going to start with with 50 g of aluminum and then we're going to convert using those same three stochiometry steps to kums now once again we need a balanced equation we don't have one yet do we well we're starting with aluminum ions in solution and we're trying to Plate out aluminum now aluminum ions have a charge of positive3 don't they so that means that our overall balanced half reaction should be al3+ plus three electrons yields aluminum once again make sure that you're able to write that otherwise you're not going to get the right answer so now we can go ahead and do our stochiometry we're starting with 50.00 gram of aluminum and we're trying to convert this to kums way down here at the end so Step One is convert to moles so in our conversion factor I need to have grams on the bottom and one mole on the top I can look at the periodic table and see that there are 26.98 G in 1 mole of aluminum so now I can cancel grams I'm in moles of aluminum so now step two is the mole ratio so use that balanced equation I'm going have to put aluminum on the bottom I'm trying to convert to electric charge so that would be electrons so electrons go on top and according to my balanced equation it's three electrons for every one aluminum so it's 3:1 in that mole ratio right out of the balanced equation so aluminum is out we're now in moles of electrons and we want to be in Kum so this is step three this is where we have to convert to final unit which is kums and we're going to use Faraday constant to do that so that means I'm going to have to put moles of electrons on the bottom and kums on the top and as we know Faraday's constant tells us there are 96,000 485 KS for every one mole of electrons so now in this last step I can cancel out both moles and electrons as you can see there and now I'm ready to do my math so 50.00 divided by 26.98 * 3 * 9648 gives me a total of about 536,000 Kum so now I have the number of kums I have the current and I want to find out the time so now I can plug into that equation i = q over T and solve for T so I is the current and the problem tells me this is a 30 amp current so that goes in there for I I know what the Q is I know what the uh uh the number of kums is I just calculated that 536,000 5 00 and I'm trying to solve for T so in my calculator when I algebraically solve here it looks like I'm going to have to take 5365 and divide that by 30 so when I solve I get that the answer is 17,8 180 seconds so what does that mean I mean that doesn't mean a whole lot to us so so if we divide that by 60 we can see how many minutes that would be that's about 200 198th minutes and maybe that's still even a bit hard to to Fathom so if we divide that by 60 once more we can convert that into to hours and minutes and we find that it's 4 hours and 58 minutes so it's going to take almost 5 hours to Plate out just 50 measly Gams of aluminum using a pretty hefty 30 amp current so hope you've learned something about electrolysis is and the stochiometry of that now we're at the end of the nine units of the AP Chemistry curriculum if you've watched all these videos you've watched over a hundred videos at this point and so maybe you're wondering what now I know it all right well at this point it's time to review so you can go into my AP review videos and I have basically uh each unit summarized into an approximate 10minute video so instead of having to watch all 100 videos over again you can refresh your memory by watching you know 10 minutes on unit one 10 minutes on unit two 10 minutes on unit three and get through the entire Course Review in about an hour and a half or so I hope you have enjoyed this video in all these videos I'm Jeremy Krug I've been teaching AP Chemistry for about 24 years and I hope you have learned something in these videos if you have please slam that thumbs up button I hope to see you again in my review videos thanks for watching and keep learning chemistry","4,148",0,101
